				<desc>This is the ability to keep books of account, to examine the condition of a business, etc. A successful Accounting roll (requires at least two hours of study, and possibly months to audit a large corporation) can tell you whether financial records are correct, and possibly reveal evidence of forgery, tampering, and similar criminal activity. Modifiers: The time modifiers under Time Spent (p. 346) often apply; the Talents (p. 89) of Business Acumen and Mathematical Ability both provide a bonus.</desc>

				<desc>This is the ability to perform gymnastic stunts, roll, take falls, etc. This can be handy on an adventure, as tightrope walking, human pyramids, and trapeze swinging all have useful applications. Each trick requires a separate skill roll, at whatever penalties the GM sees fit. If you are performing stunts on a moving vehicle or mount, roll against the lower of Acrobatics and the appropriate Driving or Riding skill. You may substitute an Acrobatics roll for a DX roll in any attempt to jump, roll, avoid falling down, etc. As well, you may attempt an Acrobatic Dodge in combat â€“ a jump or roll that avoids an attack in a flashy way (see Acrobatic Dodge, p. 375). Finally, a successful Acrobatics roll will reduce the effective distance of any fall by five yards (see Falling, p. 431). Two special versions of Acrobatics are also available: Aerobatics: The ability to execute tight turns, loops, power dives, etc. in flight. You must be able to fly to learn this skill â€“ although how you fly (magic, wings, jet pack, etc.) is irrelevant. Natural fliers might find flight to be as effortless as humans find walking, but they must still learn Aerobatics in order to engage in complex acrobatics. Add Aquabatics: The ability to engage in underwater acrobatics. Prerequisites: Swimming, or the Amphibious advantage (p. 40) or the Aquatic disadvantage Acrobatics, Aerobatics, and Aquabatics default to one another at -4. Add +1 to these three skills if you have Perfect Balance (p. 74).</desc>

The GM may also require an Acting roll whenever you try to fool someone, play dead in combat, etc. Impersonation is a special type of acting. To impersonate someone, you must first successfully disguise yourself tims cannot see you! Note that Acting is not the same Fast-Talk (the art of the "quick con") or Performance (the skill of screen and stage acting). Modifiers: +1 for every point of IQ you have over the person you are trying to fool (or the smartest one in the group), or -1 for every point of difference if your victim is smarter than you; for Shyness (p. 154); -5 for Truthfulness deceive someone. For impersonation only: -5 if you are not well acquainted with your subject; -5 if those you wish to fool are acquaintances of the subject</desc>

				<desc>This is the ability to train and work with animals. You must specialize in a category of animals â€“ the more intelligent the animals, the narrower the category. Examples of interest to adventurers: Big Cats (jaguars, lions, tigers, etc.), Dogs, Equines (horses and donkeys), and Raptors (eagles, falcons, and hawks). The default between specialties is -2 within the same order (e.g., Dogs to Big Cats), -4 across orders (e.g., Dogs to Equines), and -6 for larger differences (e.g., Dogs to Raptors). To train an animal, make an Animal Handling roll once per day of training. A failed roll means the animal learned nothing; a badly failed roll means you are attacked. The time it takes to train an animal depends on the beast's intelligence and tractability When working with a trained animal, roll against skill for each task you set the animal. This roll is at -5 if the animal is not familiar with you, -5 if the circumstances are stressful to the animal, and -3 or more if the task is a complex one. To put on an entertaining circus act, snake-charming show, etc., you must make a separate Performance roll! This skill can also (sometimes) be used to quiet a wild, dangerous, or untrained animal. This roll is at -5 if the creature is wild or very frightened, or -10 if it is a man-eater or man-killer. Finally, this skill gives an advantage in combat against animals within your specialty. If you have Animal Handling at level 15, an animal's attack and defense rolls are at -1 against you, because you can predict its behavior. At skill 20, the animal's rolls are at -2.</desc>

				</skillDefault>
				<desc>This skill represents familiarity with the people, places, and politics of a given region. You usually have Area Knowledge only for the area you con- sider your “home base,” whether that’s a single farm or a solar system. If information about other areas is avail- able, the GM may allow you to learn additional Area Knowledge skills. The GM should not require Area Knowledge rolls for ordinary situa- tions; e.g., to find the blacksmith, tav- ern, or your own home. But he could require a roll to locate a smith to shoe your horse at 3 a.m., or to find the best ambush spot along a stretch of road. “Secret” or obscure information might give a penalty, require a Hidden Lore skill (p. 199), or simply be unavailable – GM’s decision. For instance, Area Knowledge of Washington, D.C. gives you the location of the Russian Embassy, but not the KGB’s current safe house. The information covered by Area Knowledge often overlaps such skills as Current Affairs, Geography, Naturalist, and Streetwise. The differ- ence is that Area Knowledge works for a single area: you know the habits of this tiger or gang boss, but have no special insight into tigers or gangs in general. You can learn Area Knowledge for any sort of area. The larger the territo- ry, the less “personal” and more gener- al your knowledge becomes. Almost everyone will have Area Knowledge of some type. The “canonical” area classes are: Neighborhood: For an urban area: the residents and buildings of a few city blocks. For a rural area: the inhab- itants, trails, streams, hiding places, ambush sites, flora, and fauna of a few hundred acres. Village or Town: All important citi- zens and businesses, and most unim- portant ones; all public buildings and most houses. City: All important businesses, streets, citizens, leaders, etc. Barony, County, Duchy, or Small Nation: General nature of its settle- ments and towns, political allegiances, leaders, and most citizens of Status 5+. Large Nation: Location of its major cities and important sites; awareness of its major customs, ethnic groups, and languages (but not necessarily expertise); names of folk of Status 6+; and a general understanding of the economic and political situation. Planet: As for a large nation, but more general; knowledge of people of Status 7+ only. Interplanetary State: Location of major planets; familiarity with all known races (but not necessarily expertise); knowledge of people of Status 7+; general understanding of the economic and political situation. Galaxy: Location of the capitals of interplanetary states and the homeworlds of major races; general awareness of all major races; knowl- edge of individuals of Status 8; gener- al understanding of relations between interplanetary states. Area Knowledge for anything larg- er than a galaxy would be meaning- lessly vague. Your IQ-4 default applies to any of these classes, as long as you have lived in the area. Defaults are limited by “common knowledge” at your tech level! A TL0 hunter would have a default for every level up to “Village or Town,” while a TL8 student would have defaults up to “Planet” level. You must live in an interplanetary or inter- stellar state to have defaults for levels above “Planet.” In some game worlds, Area Knowledge specialties may exist for parallel realities and other dimensions – Area Knowledge (Cyberspace), Area Knowledge (Dream Realms), etc. The knowledge such skills provide is left to the GM’s judgment.</desc>

				<desc>This is the ability to build, modify, and repair a specific class of weapons or armor. (It does not include skill at design; for that, see Engineer, p. 190.) A successful roll lets you find a problem, if it isn't obvious; a second roll lets you repair it. Time required is up to the GM. You must specialize in one of the following fields: Battlesuits: All kinds of powered armor, along with any built-in weaponry. Body Armor: Any kind of unpowered personal armor (but not shields). Also defaults to Smith (Bronze)-3 at TL1, to Smith (Iron)-3 at TL2-4, and to Machinist-3 at TL5+. Force Shields: Any kind of force screen or deflector â€“ be it personal or vehicular. This is the same skill as Electronics Repair (Force Shields). Heavy Weapons: All weapons used with the Artillery and Gunner skills. Melee Weapons: Any weapon used with a Melee Weapon or Thrown Weapon skill, as well as all kinds of shields. Also defaults to Smith TL2-4, and to Machinist-3 at TL5+. Missile Weapons: Man-portable, pre-gunpowder projectile weapons of all kinds â€“ bows, crossbows, slings, etc. Small Arms: All weapons used with the Beam Weapons and Guns skills. Also defaults to Machinist-5 at TL5+. Vehicular Armor: All kinds of armored vehicle hulls. Most specialties default to one another at -4 â€“ but above TL4, there is no default between Armoury specialties dealing with armor and Armoury specialties dealing with weapons. The technologies covered by each specialty vary with TL. For instance, Armoury small arms at TL4, repeating small arms that fire cartridges at TL6, portable beam weapons at TL10. The GM should strictly enforce penalties for unfamiliarity. Armoury/TL10 (Small Arms) might cover both beam weapons and portable railguns, but going from one to the other gives you -2 to skill until you familiarize yourself with all the differences. Modifiers: -2 for an unfamiliar item within your specialty (e.g., plate armor when you're used to mail); equipment modifiers (p. 345).</desc>

				<desc>This is the ability to use a heavy weapon, such as a trebuchet or a howitzer, for indirect fire â€“ that is, to put fire onto a target area via a high ballistic arc or similar path. For direct fire, use Gunner skill (p. 198). Roll against Artillery skill to bombard the target. Loaders can make ST-based Artillery rolls to improve the rate of fire of certain crew-served heavy weapons. See the appropriate weapon description for details. You must specialize by weapon type. The available specialties vary by TL, but include one or more of: Beams: Any kind of heavy energy weapon that is fired from orbit, bounced off a mirror, or otherwise used against targets you cannot see. Bombs: All kinds of unpowered, free-falling munitions. Cannon: Any kind of heavy projectile weapon â€“ bombard, howitzer, naval gun, etc. Catapult: Any kind of indirect-fire mechanical siege engine, such as a trebuchet. Guided Missile: Any kind of seeking or remotely piloted missile. Torpedoes: Any kind of powered underwater projectile. There is no default between specialties, some of which (e.g., Torpedoes) cover weapons that bear little or no resemblance to true artillery. Artillery is a single skill only because all the weapons it covers use the same rules. The weapons covered by each specialty will vary by TL. For instance, Artillery (Cannon) would cover primitive bombards at TL3, brass cannon at TL4, breech-loading howitzers at TL6, and orbital railguns at TL9+. Familiarity is crucial here! Artillery mortars and 406mm naval guns, but going from one to the other will give -2 for weapon type (81mm vs. 406mm), fire-direction center), and -2 for mount (bipod vs. naval turret), for a total of -6 to skill until you familiarize yourself with all the differences. Note that Forward Observer skill nate targets for Artillery skill. Modifiers: All relevant combat modifiers; -2 for an unfamiliar firecontrol system (e.g., map coordinates when you're used to satellite imagery) or mount (e.g., a naval turret when you're used to emplaced guns), or for an unfamiliar weapon of a known type 203mm); -4 or more for a weapon in bad repair.</desc>

				<desc>This skill represents talent at a visual art. A successful roll might let you create a recognizable likeness of a person or an object, or a work beautiful enough to sell (the GM should not allow a default roll for this use!). Time required is up to the GM. Artist is based on IQ, but there are many situations in which the GM could logically ask for a DX-based roll, in which case modifiers for High Manual Dexterity (p. 59) or HamFisted (p. 138) would apply. In rare cases, even a ST-based Artist roll might make sense â€“ for instance, to work with a physically tough material. You must specialize in an art form. Common specialties include: Body Art: Tattooing, piercing, and scarification. Both this specialty and Painting suffice for henna or temporary tattoos, but cosmetic surgery requires Surgery skill (p. 223). Calligraphy: Beautiful and decorative handwriting. You need not be literate! Drawing: All forms of charcoal, ink, pastel, and pencil work. Illumination: Decorating written text with miniature paintings and pictures. Illusion: Creating believable or evocative illusions. Prerequisite: magical or psionic illusion ability of some kind. Interior Decorating: Creating pleasing building interiors by selecting appropriate paints, fixtures, and furniture. Default: Architecture-3. Painting: All forms of painting, whether on paper, canvas, or a wall, and whether with tempera, oil-based paint, or something more exotic (like blood). Pottery: Working with various sorts of ceramics â€“ especially clay. Scene Design: Designing sets for the stage. Default: Architecture-3. Sculpting: Creating three-dimensional art from ivory, stone, metal, etc. Woodworking: All forms of fine woodwork, including cabinet-making and decorative carving. Default: Carpentry-3. Calligraphy, Drawing, Illumination, and Painting default to one another at -2, and to or from Body Art at -4. Interior Decorating, Scene Design, and Woodworking default among themselves at -4. All other Artist specialties default to one another at -6. An artist of any kind can take a further optional specialty (p. 169) in a particular medium or technique. Many Artist specialties are used to earn a living rather than to create fine art, and some people regard them as you whether you focus on beauty, realism, or functionality. Modifiers: Equipment modifiers (p. 345); -2 if the medium is unfamiliar oils); -5 if the medium is difficult (e.g., marble, for a sculptor).</desc>

You get +2 to skill to perform a specific, lengthy mental task (e.g., break a code or write a computer program), but -2 to all unrelated IQ, Perception, and skill rolls. The task must be a relatively sedate one, done in a quiet place wilderness). Increase Will. You get +2 to Will (+5 on a critical success) for one hour.

				<desc>Prerequisites: Trained By A Master or Weapon Master. You have learned to fight blindfolded or in absolute darkness. As a result, you can "sense" your targets without having to see them. This skill enables you to use senses other than vision â€“ mainly hearing, but also touch and even smell â€“ to pinpoint exactly where your opponents are. A successful roll allows one melee attack or active defense without any penalties for lighting (even total darkness), blindness (temporary or permanent), or an invisible foe. However, attacks made in total darkness, while blind, or against invisible enemies have an extra. If you also know Zen Archery (p. 228), you can shoot targets without seeing them by making rolls on both skills at -6. An opponent who knows you possess this ability can foil it by winning a Quick Contest of Stealth-4 vs. your Blind Fighting each turn. If he wins, you cannot detect him. However, Invisibility Art (p. 202) never works on you; it is completely useless against this skill. Modifiers: Background noise gives a penalty: -1 for rain, -2 for heavy rain or a storm, -3 for a crowded, noisy area or heavy machinery, -4 for a full football stadium, or -5 in the middle of an artillery barrage. If you cannot hear at all, the roll is at -7, but you may still attempt a roll, as the skill is not completely based on hearing. Add your level of Acute Hearing to the roll. Add the higher of your ESP Talent (p. 256) or Telepathy Talent (p. 257).</desc>

A successful roll allows one melee attack or active defense without any penalties for lighting (even total darkness), blindness (temporary or permanent), or an invisible foe. However, attacks made in total darkness, while blind, or against invisible enemies have an extra -2 to target specific hit locations. If you also know Zen Archery (p. 228), you can shoot targets without seeing them by making rolls on both skills at -6. An opponent who knows you possess this ability can foil it by winning a Quick Contest of Stealth-4 vs. your Blind Fighting each turn. If he wins, you cannot detect him. However, Invisibility Art (p. 202) never works on you; it is completely useless against this skill. Modifiers: Background noise gives a penalty: -1 for rain, -2 for heavy rain or a storm, -3 for a crowded, noisy area or heavy machinery, -4 for a full football stadium, or -5 in the middle of an artillery barrage. If you cannot hear at all, the roll is at -7, but you may still attempt a roll, as the skill is not completely based on hearing. Add your level of Acute Hearing to the roll. Add the higher of your ESP Talent (p. 256) or Telepathy Talent (p. 257).</desc>

One use of this skill is to enter a deathlike trance, during which only those who can win a Quick Contest of Diagnosis vs. your Body Control skill even realize that you are alive. This requires (30 imum one second. You can also use this skill to flush poisons from your body. To do so, you must first roll against Poisons (or Alchemy, Pharmacy, etc., as appropriate) to identify the poison. You cannot attempt this roll until you know you have been poisoned. In most cases, you only discover this when the first symptoms show! A successful Body Control roll â€“ adjusted by any modifier to the HT roll to resist the poison â€“ flushes the poison in 1d hours, after which it has no further effect. Finally, you may use the higher of this skill and basic HT to resist any Affliction, magic spell, or psionic attack that is normally resisted by HT.</desc>

Only intelligence, military, and security services teach it â€“ and only to individuals with suitable Rank or Security Clearance. Even then, it is rare outside police states (except perhaps during wartime). Brainwashing encompasses many techniques â€“ some proven, others little better than witchcraft. Depending on the setting, these might include drugs, electroshock, hypnotism, sensory deprivation, sleep deprivation, social pressure, subliminal messages, or surgery . . . and most likely a combination of several of these. Regardless of the techniques employed, brainwashing is handled as a Regular Contest (not a Quick Contest) between Brainwashing skill and the victim's Will. Roll once per day. Obviously, the brainwasher has a tremendous advantage: even if the victim wins this time, it is only a matter of time before he slips. Results depend on how effective the GM deems brainwashing to be, but might include insanity, personality alteration, or suggestions that can be triggered by future events. In game terms, the victim can acquire almost any mental quirk or disadvantage. In settings where neural interfaces exist, it might be possible to "hack" the victim's brain using a computer. This takes only a fraction of a second per attempt! Brain Hacking should be treated as its own skill, with Computer Hacking instead of Psychology as a prerequisite. This skill normally has no default. However, GMs who wish to explore the gory details can specify the techniques used in their campaign and have Brainwashing default to one or more of Electronics Operation (Medical)-6, Hypnotism-6, Interrogation-6, Pharmacy-6, Psychology-6, or Surgery6, as appropriate.</desc>

Roll against skill after you hit. Breaking Blow costs 1 FP per attempt, whether or not you hit. On a success, your attack gains an armor divisor of (5) against any braced, inanimate, homogenous target (see Injury to Unliving, Homogenous, and Diffuse Targets, p. 380), and you may treat the target as if it were Fragile (Brittle) (p. 136) for this one attack. In a cinematic game, you are not limited to inanimate targets. Your armor divisor affects any artificial armor or force field (not natural DR), and you may treat homogenous opponents as if they were Fragile (Brittle)! On a failure, your attack gains no special benefits. On a critical failure, you do the damage to your own hand or foot. Modifiers: -10 if used instantly, dropping to -5 after 1 turn of concentration, -4 after 2 turns, -3 after 4 turns, -2 after 8 turns, -1 after 16 turns, and no penalty after 32 turns. -1 if your target is wood or plastic, -3 if brick or stone, or -5 if metal or hightech composites.</desc>

Make a skill roll for basic map or chart reading, practical meteorology, or to recall laws and regulations that pertain to your vehicle. This skill also lets you steer the vessel. It is easier than Piloting, Submarine, and similar skills because it only includes knowledge of how to steer. Specialists handle such activities as plotting courses and operating sensors. These experts report to the captain, who in turn tells you how to maneuver. Make a DX-based skill roll whenever you take the helm â€“ but note that your effective skill cannot exceed your captain's Shiphandling skill The average Crewman skill of an entire crew can be used as a measure of overall crew quality. The GM rolls against average skill whenever the vehicle arrives or departs, in unfavorable conditions, or in battle. Failure and critical failure results depend on the circumstances. There is a separate skill for each class of vessel: Airshipman/TL: The skill of handling ballast, gas valves, mooring lines, etc. on a blimp, zeppelin, or other large airship. Seamanship/TL: The skill of operating anchors, hatches, mooring lines, pumps, sails, windlasses, etc. aboard a large surface ship (but not a submarine). Spacer/TL: The skill of working with airlocks, docking clamps, hull patches, pressure doors, etc. on a large spacecraft or space base. Submariner/TL: The skill of handling pressure doors, pumps, valves, etc. aboard a submarine or in an undersea base. </desc>

				<desc>This is the ability to create and defeat encryption systems, codes, and ciphers. It is of use in wartime, espionage, and even business dealings. It covers all the techniques of your TL, which can range from unsophisticated substitution ciphers to state-of-theart tactical encryption schemes. Knowledge of a specific system, code, or cipher depends on your Security Clearance (p. 82) and allegiances many settings, some level of Security Clearance is a prerequisite to learning this skill at all. Treat an attempt to break an unknown code as a Quick Contest of Cryptography skill between the codebreaker and code-maker. The codebreaker must win to break the code. Repeated attempts are possible, but each attempt takes a day. The codemaker rolls only once, when he first creates the code. Those with Cryptography skill may take an optional specialty (p. 169) in making or breaking codes. (The codebreaking specialty is often called Cryptography normally has no IQ default, with two exceptions. Anyone can devise a trivial code or cipher by making an IQ-5 roll. This won't stall a professional for long, of course. Likewise, anyone can make an IQ-5 roll to attempt to break such a trivial code (but not a code devised by someone with Cryptography skill), using the Quick Contest system described above. Modifiers: Mathematical Ability software gives a bonus (provided you know Computer Operation skill): +1 for a home computer, +2 for a minicomputer, +3 or +4 for a mainframe, and +5 or more for a supercomputer. The code-breaker is at +5 if he has a sample of the code with translation, and -5 if the message to be decoded is shorter than 25 words. The codemaker receives a bonus for the time taken to create the code: consult the Size and Speed/Range Table (p. 550), look up the time in days in the Range/Speed column (substituting sponding bonus.</desc>

High Culture: Information on galleries, operas, symphonies, and so forth. People: The names of and gossip on celebrities, heads of state, and the like. Politics: Election results, international treaties, etc. Popular Culture: Hit songs, cool fashions, and hot products, among other things. Regional: News of all kinds for a specific region (pick one). This is the definitive "town crier" skill at low TLs. Science &amp; Technology: New discoveries and inventions. Sports: Scores for recent matches, names of star athletes, etc. Travel: Where the "beautiful people" are going this year, and how much it all costs. These specialties default to one another at -4. It is hard to bone up on one kind of news without learning about all the others! On a successful Current Affairs roll, the GM will inform you of any news within your specialty that pertains to the current adventure (possibly including clues, on a good roll) or give you a small skill bonus (e.g., a success on Current Affairs (Sports) might give +1 to Gambling skill when betting on a boxing match). Modifiers: -1 per day that you have been unable to access news media; -3 if you only have one source; +1 or more for "inside" access to the news (a subscription to an ordinary wire service is worth +1, while a job at an intelligence agency might give +3 or more).</desc>

				<desc>This is the art of altering your appearance using clothing, makeup, and prosthetics. You do not need this skill to don a quick disguise â€“ e.g., to put on a lab coat when you enter a laboratory â€“ but such disguises only fool the inattentive! A good disguise requires a Disguise roll and 30 minutes to an hour of preparation. Roll a Quick Contest of Disguise skill vs. the Perception of each person your disguise must fool. Individuals with Criminology or Observation skill may substitute those skills for Perception when rolling to penetrate a disguise. The GM may allow other skills to be of use â€“ for instance, Physician skill might help spot a rubber nose. When combining Acting (p. 174) with Disguise (that is, when you must change your face and your personality), you need only make one roll for each person or group â€“ but it must be the harder of the two rolls. If there is more than one sapient species in your world, you must specialize by race â€“ Disguise (Human) is nothing like Disguise (Bug-Eyed Monster). Disguise specialized in your own species is the most common form; just list this as "Disguise" on your character sheet. Disguise skills for physically similar species default to one another at -2 to -4. Modifiers: Equipment modifiers You are at -1 to -5 to disguise yourself as someone very different from you ance also gives a penalty â€“ see Build and specific disadvantages (e.g., Hunchback, p. 139) for details. Differences in Size Modifier usually make Disguise impossible. You can also learn Disguise tures. This involves wearing animal skins, smearing your body with musk or dung, etc. There is no default between this and other Disguise specialties. Use the following modifiers instead of those given above. Modifiers: +2 if approaching from downwind; -1 for each animal over one of the same type being approached (-1 for every 10 in the case of herd animals); -1 to -3 if the skins are old or in poor condition. Make a Naturalist roll to recall the habits of the animal being imitated; success gives +1 to +3, while failure gives -1 to -3.</desc>

Available specialties vary by game world, but might include: Communications (Comm): All forms of electronic communications technology: radios, satellite uplinks, laser communicators, etc. Includes knowledge of any standard, current communications codes appropriate to your background. These do not require a skill roll â€“ although attempts to understand or use an unfamiliar code do require a roll. At TL5-7, this includes telegraphy: you can send or receive 2 words per minute (wpm) per point of skill at TL5, 3 wpm per point of skill at TL6-7. Electronic Warfare (EW): All signals-intelligence and jamming equipment, including electronic countermeasures (ECM) and electronic counter-countermeasures (ECCM). In most game worlds, only intelligence agencies and the military teach this specialty â€“ and only to individuals with suitable Military Rank (p. 30) or Security Clearance (p. 82). Force Shields: Portable, vehicular, base, and starship force shields and deflectors. Matter Transmitters (MT): All matter transmitters and teleporters. Critical failures can be disastrous, especially when transmitting living beings! Media: All forms of audio, film, and video editing equipment. If threedimensional video ("holographics") or sensory recordings ("sensies") exist in the setting, this specialty includes the ability to operate the relevant equipment. Treat different media as mutually unfamiliar technologies. Medical: All manner of electronic diagnostic and life-support equipment. Parachronic: Technological means of travel between dimensions or timelines. Psychotronics: Psionic technology, such as telepathic shields and amplifiers. Scientific: Laboratory electronics and survey gear. You are automatically familiar with the equipment used with any scientific skill on which you have spent at least one point. Security: Both operating and circumventing all forms of alarms, security sensors, and area-surveillance technology. Sensors: Most forms of long-range detection gear, from air-defense radar to starship sensor suites. Certain highly specialized sensors (such as sonar, below) have their own specialties. Sonar: All types of acoustic detection and ranging gear (normally used underwater). Surveillance: All forms of concealable or remote surveillance gear: microphones, wiretaps, etc. Temporal: All manner of time machines. Critical failures can be disastrous for the time travelers! Make separate rolls to "lock onto" and transfer the travelers. These specialties default to one another at -4; however, the GM is free to rule that in his campaign, there is no default between exotic specialties mundane ones (Media, Security, etc.). The technologies covered by a particular specialty vary with TL. For instance, Electronics Operation (Comm) covers telegraphs at TL5, telephones and radios at TL6, and digital communications systems at TL8 . . . and might cover faster-than-light or telepathic communicators at higher TLs. Familiarity (p. 169) is crucial here! Electronics Operation/TL8 (Sensors) covers both thermographs on fighter jets and ground-penetrating radars on satellites, but going from one to the other gives you -2 for type (thermograph to radar) and -2 for implementation (jet to satellite), for a net -4 to skill until you familiarize yourself with all the differences. Modifiers: Equipment modifiers ogy of a known type (e.g., radar when you are used to thermograph) or an unfamiliar implementation of a familiar technology (e.g., air-defense radar when you are used to weather radar); the field for a long time (this varies by field) and have not had a chance to become familiar with the changes.</desc>

				<desc>Prerequisites: Charisma 1 and Public Speaking at 12+. Bards in fantasy can often influence others through storytelling. The GM may choose to represent this ability using the four Enthrallment skills described below. Depending on the setting, these skills might be magical, psionic, or a cinematic form of hypnotism. Each has a time requirement, FP cost, and duration, and requires two skill rolls to use. At the outset of the tale, roll vs. Public Speaking skill; if you can't grab your audience's attention early on, you won't have much of a chance of controlling them by the end. On a success, proceed to the Enthrallment skill roll; critical success gives +1 on that roll. On a failure, you may still attempt the Enthrallment roll, but at a penalty equal to your margin of failure. Critical failure means your Enthrallment attempt fails automatically. After the time required to enthrall has passed, roll a Quick Contest of your Enthrallment skill vs. the Will of each audience member. If you win, you affect your audience â€“ see the individual skill description for effects. If you lose or tie, there is no effect. However, if you critically fail, your audience instantly turns hostile! You may never learn these skills at a skill level higher than your Public Speaking skill. Audience Size: An "audience" can be one listener or a hundred â€“ as many as can hear the tale. However, the number of audience members that you can enthrall at one sitting is limited to your Charisma level squared, to a maximum of 25 people at Charisma 5. Modifiers: All four Enthrallment skills are at -3 for Low Empathy good tale, the GM should reward him with +1 to +3 to the Public Speaking and Enthrallment rolls!</desc>

If you win the Quick Contest, the audience becomes intensely loyal to you. They follow any direct order you give. In the absence of a direct order, they act in your best interest, as they understand it. If you tell someone to do something very hazardous, or that goes against his usual code of behavior (GM's decision), he gets a Will-5 roll to break the captivation. Otherwise, he is your loyal supporter for all intents and purposes. Time: 30 minutes of uninterrupted storytelling. Fatigue Cost: 8 FP, whether successful or not. Duration: Captivation lasts until the subject becomes unconscious or falls asleep, you become unconscious or fall asleep, you attack the subject, or the subject loses half his HP to injury.</desc>

				<desc>This is training in the use of a specific class of protective suit. Suits designed to shield the wearer from environmental or battlefield hazards frequently incorporate gadgets (such as autoinjectors and sensors) and lifesupport equipment. Some suits even contain motors to enhance ST or Move. As a result, you do not merely wear such gear â€“ you operate it. Roll against Environment Suit skill to get into or out of your suit quickly. A successful roll halves the time required. To activate a specific subsystem of a suit, or to gauge whether a suit is in good repair, make an IQbased skill roll instead. When rolling against DX or any DX-based skill while suited up, use the lower of your Environment Suit skill and your actual skill level. For instance, if you have DX 14, Stealth15, and Vacc Suit-13, you will function at DX 13 and Stealth-13 while wearing a spacesuit. Particularly ungainly suits might give -1 or more to DX on top of this, regardless of skill level. On the other hand, some sleek, ultra-tech suits might not limit skills at all! However, Environment Suit is strictly the skill of donning and operating the suit. Familiarity with and knowledge of dangerous environments is covered by other skills: Free Fall, Hazardous Materials, Survival, etc. Each suit type requires its own skill. Examples include: Battlesuit/TL: All kinds of powered battle armor and exoskeletons. Battle armor and exoskeletons are similar but not identical. If you only have experience with one, you are at -2 to operate the other until you gain familiarity (see Familiarity, p. 169). Diving Suit/TL: All types of hard diving suits (as opposed to the wetsuits and drysuits used with Scuba skill). This includes "open dress" gear at TL5 and "hard hat" gear at TL6, both of which use a sealed helmet and supplied air, but not always a full, sealed suit. At TL7+, this skill covers true underwater "hardsuits." The GM may require Swimming rolls to maneuver while wearing such a suit. Default: Scuba-2. NBC Suit/TL: All forms of hazardous materials ("HazMat") gear â€“ including sealed, unpowered body armor that can be buttoned down against nuclear-biological-chemical run the risk of misusing the equipment and being exposed to contamination. To improvise NBC gear, make an IQbased skill roll at -5 to -15 to skill. Vacc Suit/TL: Any kind of spacesuit. In addition to true vacuum suits, this includes suits intended for use in highpressure, corrosive, and poisonous atmospheres. Battlesuit, NBC Suit, and Vacc Suit default among themselves at -2. Diving Suit defaults to or from any other Environment Suit skill at -4. Note that unpowered, unsealed body armor never requires an Environment Suit skill.</desc>

You suffer only half these penalties if you dislocate the restrained limb (usually an arm). This requires (20 skill) minutes of concentration, minimum one minute and a Will roll. However, if you fail your Escape roll by 3 or more when dislocating a limb, the limb suffers 1d damage. On a critical failure, you automatically take enough damage to cripple the limb!

				<desc>This is the ability to drive a spirit from a possessed person or haunted location. It is not a magical skill, but a religious ritual. Exorcism is not specific to any one religion. A Malay witch doctor and a Catholic priest can both perform exorcisms; their relative effectiveness depends on the originating culture of the spirit. The length of the ritual is 15 minutes Â¥ the spirit's HT. Some spirits wait patiently through the ritual, anticipating the combat to come; others try to distract or even attack you before you can complete the ritual. Once the ritual is complete, roll against Exorcism skill. On a failure, the spirit remains and you must wait at least a week before you can repeat the ritual. On a critical failure, immediately roll 3d+10 on the Fright Check Table (p. 360). Even if you keep your sanity, you may never attempt to exorcise this particular spirit again. On a critical success, you immediately banish the spirit. On a regular success, you meet your opponent in a Quick Contest: your Exorcism skill vs. the higher of the spirit's ST or Will. When fighting a spirit in a living host, add higher of the ST or Will of the possession victim to your Exorcism skill as he tries to "push the spirit out." If the spirit wins or ties, it retains its current status and you must wait at least a week before you can repeat the ritual. If you win, you drive the spirit from its haunt or victim. The spirit of a deceased mortal is laid to rest. For demons and similar entities, make a reaction roll. On a "Poor" or better reaction, the spirit flees in humiliation. On a "Bad" or worse reaction, the spirit immediately uses whatever resources it has to take vengeance on you and those nearby. If the exorcism fails at any stage, make an IQ roll afterward. A success means that you learned something about the spirit that will help you in your next attempt to banish that foe, giving you +2 on later skill rolls. You may only claim this bonus once for a particular spirit. Modifiers: -4 if you do not have one or more of Blessed (p. 40), Power Investiture (p. 77), or True Faith ual, but you lack holy support.</desc>

Can substitute for Artillery, Armoury, Strategy, or Tactics to answer questions about â€“ but not use â€“ weapons or strategies. Natural Philosophy: A general skill that usually replaces specific science skills (which might not even exist yet!) for scholars at TL1-4. Can be used in place of any science skill (e.g., Biology or Physics) to answer questions about how the universe is believed to work. Political Science: The academic study of politics.

Can function as Biology, Diagnosis, Physician, Physiology, or Psychology when dealing with psi phenomena in living beings. Cannot substitute for Electronics Operation, Electronics Repair, and Engineer specialties that deal with psychotronics. Thanatology: The esoteric study of death. Can stand in for Anthropology, Archaeology, Occultism, or Theology when dealing with death and the dead. Xenology: General knowledge of the known races in your setting.

				<desc>This is the skill of working with explosives and incendiaries. You must specialize: Demolition: The ability to prepare and set explosives in order to blow things up. Make a roll whenever you use explosives in this way. A failure indicates an error. The gravity of the error depends on the amount by which you failed; a badly failed roll in close quarters can blow you up! Time required varies â€“ it takes only a couple of seconds to set a prepared charge, but it might take hours to demolish a large bridge or a skyscraper. When setting an explosive trap, use this skill rather than Traps. Rolls to set a "trap" fuse (e.g., a land mine) instead of a timed fuse are at Explosive Ordnance Disposal pose of bombs and other explosives. When disarming a trap, roll a Quick Contest of your Explosives (EOD) skill vs. the Explosives (Demolition) skill of the person who created the device. A failure (or even a critical failure) does not necessarily mean an explosion â€“ the GM can be much more creative than that! Sudden hissing noises, mysterious parts falling off, cramps, itches, and alarm bells are all possible in the right circumstances. It is best if the GM rolls the dice and describes the physical circumstances to the victim. Fright Checks are appropriate for the survivors of a failed EOD attempt! Prerequisite: DX 12+. Fireworks: The skill of making pyrotechnic devices â€“ fireworks, flares, smoke bombs, flash grenades, etc. Most of these things can be used by anyone. Default: Chemistry-3. Nuclear Ordnance Disposal a military nuclear weapon is straightforward; disarming a homemade terrorist bomb might be more difficult. Only a critical failure verified by a second critical failure will result in a nuclear detonation. Any lesser failure will â€“ at worst â€“ detonate the highexplosive trigger and contaminate the immediate area with radioactive material . . . not that this is a great deal of consolation to those nearby. Underwater Demolition (UD): The ability to prepare and set explosives underwater. This is otherwise identical to Explosives (Demolition). You usually need Scuba skill â€“ or at least Swimming skill â€“ to get into a position where you can use this skill. These specialties default to one another at -4 except for Demolition and UD, which default to one another at -2, and EOD and NOD, which also default to one another at -2. Modifiers: Equipment modifiers enemy fire or swarms of biting ants) or physical motion (e.g., a rocking boat or speeding bus). The time modifiers under Time Spent (p. 346) will often apply.</desc>

				<desc>This skill lets you quickly draw a weapon from its holster, sheath, or hiding place. A successful roll means you ready the weapon instantly. This does not count as a combat maneuver; you can use the weapon to attack on the same turn. On a failure, you ready your weapon normally but may do nothing else on your turn. A critical failure means you drop the weapon! You must specialize in one of these weapon types: Force Sword, Knife, Long Arm (rifle, shotgun, submachine gun, etc.), Pistol, Sword (any onehanded blade larger than a knife), or Two-Handed Sword. The GM may add Fast-Draw skills for other weapons (or even tools) that one could reasonably draw quickly. In addition to the above specialties, there are two Fast-Draw skills that allow you to reload missile weapons quickly: Fast-Draw (Arrow): Lets you ready a single arrow, bolt, or dart instantly. This reduces the time required to reload a bow, crossbow, or blowgun by one second. Fast-Draw/TL (Ammo): Reduces the time required to reload any kind of gun or beam weapon. The exact benefits depend on your weapon, but a successful roll always shaves at least one second off the reload time. This skill varies greatly with TL! At TL4, it covers powder-and-shot drills; at TL6+, it includes speed-loading techniques for detachable magazines; and at higher tech levels, it involves quickly replacing energy cells and attaching power cables. For the Arrow and Ammo specialties, failure means you drop the arrow or bolt, or accidentally discard one round of ammunition. On a critical failure, you drop the entire quiver, powder horn, ammo box, magazine, etc., scattering loose ammunition everywhere! Modifiers: Combat Reflexes (p. 43) gives +1 to all Fast-Draw specialties; Ham-Fisted (p. 138) gives -3 per level.</desc>

If you have Fast-Talk at level 20 or better, you get +2 on all reaction rolls where you're allowed to talk! Note that Fast-Talk differs from Acting (p. 174).

Make a skill roll to hit an inanimate object with your foot or an impact weapon. Add +1 per die to basic thrust or swing damage if you have this skill at DX+1, +2 per die if you know it at DX+2 or better. Add a similar bonus (+1 or +2) to ST rolls made for forced entry. The damage bonus also applies when you use Melee Weapon skills to wreck inanimate objects out of combat. For subtle break-ins, use Lockpicking skill (p. 206).</desc>

When you use a forged document, make your Forgery roll each time it is inspected â€“ unless you roll a critical success on your first attempt. Failure means someone spots the forgery. Some tasks require DX-based skill rolls, in which case modifiers for High Manual Dexterity (p. 59) or HamFisted (p. 138) apply. The GM may allow Forgery to default to a suitable Artist specialty at -5 if you are doing the work entirely by hand. Modifiers: Equipment modifiers uine document; -5 if you did not have a sample to copy.

Suitable props â€“ star charts, tea leaves, etc. â€“ can enhance the illusion. Knowledge of traditional occult or religious beliefs (especially those of your subject) can also lend an air of legitimacy. With the GM's permission, you can sometimes use Fortune-Telling in place of Fast-Talk (by making predictions that guide the subject toward a particular course of action), or Interrogation or Psychology (by asking the subject leading questions under the pretense of telling his fortune). This is only possible if the subject believes you are a genuine fortune-teller and you take the time to do a full "reading" for him. You must specialize in a particular mantic art. Available specialties include Astrology, Augury (interpretation of natural omens, such as flocks of birds), Crystal Gazing, Dream Interpretation, Feng Shui, Palmistry, and Tarot. This skill is not a paranormal talent, and the GM is under no obligation to supply you with hints of future events. You might wish to learn this skill if you have actual divinatory abilities, though, as it enables you to present your predictions in a culturally acceptable way. "I saw it in the stars" may be less likely to get you burned as a witch than "I cast a spell"! Modifiers: +1 for Sensitive or +3 for Empathy (p. 51); any Charisma bonus; -3 if using Fortune-Telling in place of Fast-Talk, Interrogation, or Psychology.</desc>

Failure means the ordnance misses the target; critical failures result in severe "collateral damage" or "friendly fire" incidents. The very worst critical failures (GM's decision) drop the ordnance on your position! At higher tech levels, Forward Observer is less about observing targets and more about operating specialized technology such as drones, GPS, and laser designators.

Includes under-barrel grenade launchers, flare pistols, and ultra-tech "tanglers." Gyroc: Any kind of small arm that fires miniature rockets. Light Anti-Armor Weapon (LAW): All forms of rocket launchers and recoilless rifles. Light Machine Gun (LMG): Any machine gun fired from the hip or a bipod. Musket: Any kind of smoothbore long arm (usually, but not always, a black powder weapon) that fires a solid projectile.

It is only available to those who study it specifically. You must specialize in a particular body of secret knowledge. If you wish to enter play with Hidden Lore skills, you must account for this specific knowledge in your character story. The GM might even require you to purchase an Unusual Background before you can learn Hidden Lore skills. Of course, the GM is also free to forbid Hidden Lore skills to starting characters . . . or to PCs in general! To acquire Hidden Lore in play, you must find a reliable source of relevant information. The GM may choose to tie skill increases in Hidden Lore to specific acts â€“ such as reading moldy tomes â€“ instead of allowing you to spend points freely. For instance, an ancient manuscript might let you spend up to eight points (and no more) on a specific Hidden Lore skill. Remember that most Hidden Lore is secret because somebody powerful wants it kept that way. Thus, discussing or revealing your knowledge can be extremely hazardous. Possible Hidden Lore specialties include: Conspiracies: You know details about the conspiracies that underlie every aspect of society. This is factual knowledge (e.g., truths about the Illuminati), not the ability to analyze conspiracies. Only available in settings where vast conspiracies really do exist. Demon Lore: You know the secrets of Hell, the goals of demons in the mortal world, and possibly even the names of specific demons.

Some examples: stamp. dime, a TL9+ computer disk, a letter. lar. 0: A TL8 floppy disk or CD, without case. handgun or grenade. Luger), a grenade, a large knife. sword, a short carbine. Things that move or make noise give an additional -1 or more to skill. Clothing also modifies effective skill. A Carmelite nun in full habit (+5 to skill) could conceal a bazooka or a battle-axe from an eyeball search. A Las Vegas showgirl in costume (-5 to skill) would have trouble hiding even a dagger. Of course, the showgirl might escape search entirely (unless the guards were bored) because "She obviously couldn't hide anything in that outfit!" Full nudity is -7 to skill. A proper concealment holster helps conceal a weapon; use the equipment modifiers on p. 345. Clothing designed specifically to hide things gives a bonus of up to +4. To spot a concealed item, roll a Quick Contest of Search skill vs. Holdout. Search defaults to Perception-5 if you haven't studied it. See Search (p. 219) for additional rules.</desc>

				<desc>This is the skill of inducing a suggestible state in another person through verbal or mechanical means. It requires five seconds and a successful skill roll to use. If you fail on a cooperative subject, you may try again. The second attempt takes five minutes, and the roll is at -5. If this attempt fails, you may not try to hypnotize the subject again that day. A successful Hypnotism attempt puts the subject to sleep. This counts as an anesthetic for the purpose of Surgery. At the GM's option, further Hypnotism rolls might help the subject remember something he had forgotten, while Psychology rolls might help him get over mental problems. A hypnotized individual is extremely suggestible. Roll a Quick Contest of Hypnotism vs. the victim's Will for each suggestion. The subject resists suggestions that threaten his life or his loved ones, or that go strongly against his character, at +5. You may also give ing the subject to do something in response to a trigger after the hypnosis ends. The subject's resistance roll for such suggestions takes place when he encounters the trigger. He resists at notized. You cannot use Hypnotism as an attack, except in highly cinematic games. You can use it on an unaware or unwilling subject out of combat, but he resists at Will+5. If he resists the initial attempt, he is considered uncooperative, and you may not make a second attempt that day. A subject who is unfamiliar with Hypnotism might not know what you attempted, but he suspects something â€“ possibly witchcraft! In all cases, a hypnotic trance lasts 1d hours unless you end it sooner. Modifiers: +2 if you send hypnotic suggestions via Telesend (see Telecommunication, p. 91), since voices in the head are harder to ignore.</desc>

This skill allows you to anchor yourself to the ground by properly channeling your chi, using secret balancing techniques, etc. Make a skill roll whenever an attack (e.g., a shove or the Push skill, p. 216) would result in knockback or a fall. On a success, you neither experience knockback nor fall down. On a failure, you are knocked back but still get the usual DX roll to avoid falling down. On a critical failure, you automatically suffer full knockback and you fall down. This skill also helps against attacks with the Judo skill (p. 203). If you fail your active defense (or choose not to defend) against a Judo throw, your attacker must win a Quick Contest of Judo vs. your Immovable Stance skill, or his throw fails.

Roll against skill to hit. You must specialize: Beam: Any energy blast, magical jet, etc. emitted from the hands. To use this skill, you must have at least one unrestrained hand (although it need not be empty). Breath: Any attack emitted from the mouth, such as dragon's fire or acidic sputum. To use this skill, you cannot be gagged and you must be facing your target. Gaze: Any attack emitted from the eyes â€“ heat vision, a petrifying stare, etc. To use this skill, you cannot be blindfolded and you must be facing your target. Projectile: Any solid projectile or pseudo-solid energy bolt (e.g., Fireball spell) emitted from the hands. To use this skill, you must have at least one unrestrained hand (although it need not be empty). These specialties default to one another at -2. You use this skill to direct your attack, not to activate it; therefore, restrictions such as "you cannot be gagged" apply strictly to your ability to make ranged attacks. If you can trigger your attack while restrained, no skill roll is needed to attack your restraints! You can only learn this skill for ranged attacks.

It allows you to deduce enemy plans and capabilities, evaluate the accuracy of information, rate the reliability of sources, etc. In most game worlds, only intelligence, military, and security services teach this skill â€“ often only to those with a minimum level of Rank or Security Clearance. The GM makes all Intelligence Analysis rolls in secret. On a success, he provides details about the significance and accuracy of your data, or insights into what it means in terms of enemy planning. When you encounter deliberately falsified data, the GM rolls a secret Quick Contest: your Intelligence Analysis vs. the enemy's skill at disinformation (Forgery, Propaganda, etc.). If you win, the GM provides details on precisely what is wrong with the information. It is up to you to deduce what this means, however! This skill has nothing to do with gathering intelligence. Use Current Affairs (p.186) and Research (p. 217) to sift through public sources; Forensics physical clues; Observation (p. 211) for human surveillance; and Electronics Operation (p. 189) to work with the satellite imagery, communications intercepts, and related "technical means" common at TL7+. You may take an optional specialty ligence. A useful specialty at TL6+ is Intelligence Analysis (Traffic Analysis): identifying the purpose and organization of targets by examining intercepted communications traffic. Modifiers: -1 to -5 for incomplete information; -3 if all your information comes from a single source; -3 for intelligence concerning an arcane scientific or bureaucratic principle, unless you have skill in that area (e.g., Engineer (Electronics) for intelligence regarding a radar installation).</desc>

If you tie or lose, the victim remains silent or lies. If you lose by more than five points, he tells you a good, believable lie! The GM roleplays the prisoner (or, if you are the prisoner, the GM will roleplay the interrogator) and makes all die rolls in secret. Modifiers: -5 if the prisoner's loyalty to his leader or cause is "Very Good" or "Excellent"; -3 for Low Empathy threats; +6 if you use torture*. Increase these last two bonuses by +1 if you have the Callous disadvantage mean thumbscrews and the rack. Exposing a prisoner to the object of his phobia (see Phobias, p. 148) is an effective torture, as is a believable threat against a loved one.

				<desc>This is the skill of hostile persuasion. The essence of Intimidation is to convince the subject that you are able and willing, perhaps even eager, to do something awful to him. You can substitute an Intimidation attempt for any reaction roll; see Influence Rolls (p. 359). Exception: You cannot intimidate someone who has the Unfazeable advantage! The results of a successful Intimidation attempt depend on the target. An honest citizen probably cooperates, sullenly or with false cheer. A low-life might lick your boots really tough sort might react well without being frightened: "You're my kind of scum!" The GM decides, and roleplays it. If you rolled a critical success â€“ or if the subject critically failed his Will roll â€“ your victim must make a Fright Check in addition to the other results of the Influence roll! Group Intimidation: You may attempt to intimidate up to 25 people at once, at -1 to skill per five people (or fraction thereof) in the group. Multiple intimidators can attempt to intimidate proportionally larger groups; for instance, three thugs could try to intimidate up to 75 people! Base the skill penalty on the size of the target group divided by the number of intimidators (round up). Resolve the outcome with a single Quick Contest: the highest effective Intimidation skill from among the intimidators vs. the highest modified Will in the target group. Specious Intimidation: You can attempt a Quick Contest of Fast-Talk vs. the subject's IQ before your Intimidation attempt in order to appear to be intimidating when you can't back it up. If you win, you are at attempt, which can go a long way toward offsetting the high Will and Fearlessness of martial arts masters, world leaders, etc. If you tie or lose, however, your Intimidation attempt fails automatically, and you suffer a Modifiers: +1 to +4 for displays of strength, bloodthirstiness, or supernatural powers (GM's judgment); increase this bonus by +1 if you are Callous if you are Hideous, +3 if Monstrous, or your Size Modifier and subtract the subject's. Appropriate Reputation modifiers (positive or negative) certainly count! You get -1 for Oblivious (p. 146) and -1 to -4 for Shyness (p. 154).

				<desc>This is the fabled skill, often attributed to ninja and other martial-arts masters, of being able to stand in plain sight without being noticed. It requires one second of concentration to activate. After that time, roll a Quick Contest once per second: your Invisibility Art vs. the Vision roll of each person who can see you. Viewers must apply the current darkness penalty to their Vision roll. A viewer who is concentrating on something else or otherwise distracted is at -3; one who is specifically looking for intruders gets +3. If someone sees you and raises the alarm, by pointing and crying out, those who believe the warning get +3 on their next roll. If you win, that person is unable to see you for one second. Otherwise, he can see you normally. Once someone notices you, he is unaffected by this skill until you can get out of sight somehow (which might be as easy as stepping into a shadow), whereupon you may try again. Note that this skill does not work at all in combat. In particular, if you attack anyone, you will immediately become visible to everyone! Modifiers: +3 if you use a smoke bomb or flash grenade before you attempt your roll (you appear to vanish in a cloud of smoke). Your movement modifies your skill roll rather than viewers’ Vision rolls: no modifier if you stand still (Move 0), -1 if you move at a slow walk (Move 1), -2 at a fast walk (Move 2), or -5 at a run (Move 3+). If you stand perfectly still (requires a successful Breath Control or Meditation roll), you get +1.</desc>

				<desc>This skill represents any advanced training at unarmed throws and grapples â€“ not just the eponymous Japanese martial art. Judo allows you to parry two different attacks per turn, one with each hand. Your Parry score is (skill/2) + 3, rounded down. This parry is not at the usual -3 for parrying a weapon barehanded, greatly reducing the likelihood of injury when you defend against an armed foe. In addition, Judo gives an improved retreating bonus when you parry; see Retreat ing barehanded, see Parrying Unarmed On the turn immediately after a successful Judo parry, you may attempt to throw your attacker if he is within one yard. This counts as an attack; roll vs. Judo skill to hit. (Note that in an All-Out Attack, you cannot attempt two throws, but you can make one attempt at +4.) Your foe may use any active defense â€“ he can parry your hand with a weapon! If his defense fails, you throw him. When you throw a foe, he falls where you please. On a battle map, he lands in any two hexes near you. One of these hexes must be his starting hex, your hex, or any hex adjacent to one of those hexes. Your victim must roll against HT; a failed roll means he is stunned! If you throw him into someone else, that person must roll against the higher of ST+3 or DX+3 to avoid being knocked down. Finally, you may use your Judo skill instead of your DX for any DX roll made in close combat except to draw a weapon or drop a shield. If you grapple a foe using Judo, and he fails to break free, you may make a Judo attack to throw him on your next turn, exactly as if you had parried his attack. To use Judo, any hand with which you wish to parry or grapple must be empty. Because Judo relies heavily on footwork, all Judo rolls and Judo parries take a penalty equal to your encumbrance level.

You cannot use Karate to attack with claws, teeth, etc., or with a blackjack â€“ use Brawling (p. 182) for that. Karate skill does let you make several special attacks, however; see Special Unarmed Combat Techniques (p. 403). Karate improves damage: if you know Karate at DX level, add +1 per die to basic thrust damage when you calculate damage with Karate attacks: punches, kicks, elbow strikes, etc. Add or better!

Few legal questions have clear-cut answers, however â€“ even an expert will hedge his advice! You must specialize. There are two general classes of specialty: region (e.g., Canada or France) within a specific field (constitutional, contract, criminal, police, etc.).

				<desc>This is the ability to use a weapon that projects a stream of liquid or gas. Roll against Liquid Projector skill to hit your target. Make an IQ-based Liquid Projector roll to take immediate action (e.g., patch a leak), should your weapon fail. You must specialize by weapon type: Flamethrower: Any weapon that projects burning liquid or gas. (This does not include plasma weapons, which are often called "flamers"; use Beam Weapons skill for those.) Sprayer: Any weapon that emits a gas or atomized liquid (nerve gas, sleeping gas, etc.), including an ordinary spray can used as an improvised weapon. Squirt Gun: Any weapon that fires a low-pressure stream of liquid at the rate of one squirt per pull of the trigger. Water Cannon: Any weapon that fires a continuous jet of high-pressure liquid, usually but not always water, with the intent of causing knockback. These specialties default to one another at -4. The weapons covered by each specialty vary by TL; e.g., Liquid Projector (Flamethrower) covers firesiphons loaded with Greek fire at TL4, while at TL6, it covers backpack tanks that project thickened fuel. Modifiers: All applicable ranged combat modifiers; -2 for heavy weapons when you are used to portable weapons (e.g., a flamethrower mounted on a tank when you are used to a backpack model), or for an unfamiliar weapon of a known type; -4 or more for a weapon in bad repair.</desc>

Defaults: Engineer Computer Science: The theoretical study of data structures and computation. Roll vs. skill to answer questions about what is possible with computers. This gives you no special ability to use computers! Default: Computer Programming-5. Cryptology: The mathematical study of codes and ciphers. This gives you a theoretical understanding of encryption schemes, including how they change with TL and why some schemes are more effective than others. To create or break codes, use Cryptography skill (p. 186). Default: Cryptography-5. Pure: Generic "academic" mathematics. Make a skill roll to answer any math-related question not covered by another specialty. Pure mathematics encompasses dozens of obscure subfields that will never affect the game. If you must be an expert in something like "non-selfadjoint operator algebras," you may further note an optional specialty (p. 169). Statistics: The science of assembling and analyzing data for the purpose of calculating probabilities, constructing models, and making forecasts. Roll vs. skill to determine the odds of a particular outcome, given sufficient data about similar situations in the past. Surveying: The science of determining the area of a portion of the Earth's surface, the lengths and directions of the bounding lines, and the contour of the surface. Make a skill roll to determine the dimensions of any area you can see. More complex determinations require specialized equipment. Defaults: Cartography-3 or Navigation (any)-4.

				<desc>This is the ability to diagnose and fix ordinary mechanical problems. A successful skill roll will let you find or repair one problem. You must pick a specialty from within one of these four categories: Machine Type: Any one class of nonvehicular machine. Types include Micromachines (miniature machinery, invisible to the naked eye; TL9+), Nanomachines (molecular-scale machinery; TL10+), and Robotics TL7+). Motive System Type: Any one type of propulsion system, regardless of vehicle type. Types include Legged, Tracked, Wheeled, Rockets, and Reactionless Thrusters. Power Plant Type: Any one type of power plant, no matter what it powers. Types include Clockwork, Steam Engine, Gasoline Engine, Diesel Engine, Gas Turbine, Fuel Cell, Fission Reactor, Fusion Reactor, and Antimatter Reactor. Vehicle Type: The controls, hull, motive system, power plant, transmission, and even the paint job of one specific type of vehicle listed under a vehicle-operation skill such as Driving Submarine (p. 223). Mechanic specialties default to one another at -4, although the GM may modify this for particularly close or distant specialties. The systems covered by each specialty vary by TL. For instance, Mechanic (Light Airplane) covers single-engine biplanes at early TL6, small private jets at TL7, and so forth. Familiarity is very important here. For instance, Mechanic/TL7 (Light Airplane) covers both propeller-powered seaplanes and small private jets, but going from one to the other gives you -2 for an unfamiliar item (proppowered plane to jet) and -2 for an unfamiliar implementation (seaplane to regular plane), for a net -4 to skill until you familiarize yourself with all the differences. Modifiers: -2 for an unfamiliar item within your specialty (e.g., a barge when you're used to battleships), or for an unfamiliar implementation used to automobile engines); equipment modifiers (p. 345).</desc>

				<desc>This is not one skill, but an entire collection of skills â€“ one per class of closely related melee weapons. Melee Weapon skills are based on DX, and default to DX-4 if Easy, DX-5 if Average, or DX-6 if Hard. See specific skill descriptions for other defaults. Make a Melee Weapon roll to hit an opponent in combat. You may also use these skills to parry. Your Parry defense is (skill/2) + 3, rounded down. Melee weapons fall into broad categories on the basis of overall balance and function. When a rule refers to one of these categories, it applies to all weapons in that category and all Melee Weapon skills used to wield them. For instance, "fencing weapons" means "all weapons used with any of Main-Gauche, Rapier, Saber, or Smallsword skill." Fencing Weapons Fencing weapons are light, onehanded weapons, usually hilted blades, optimized for parrying. If you have a fencing weapon, you get an improved retreating bonus when you parry â€“ see Retreat (p. 377). Furthermore, you have half the usual penalty for parrying more than once with the same hand (see Parrying, p. 376). Note that fencing weapons are light and likely to break when used to parry a heavier weapon. They cannot parry flail weapons at all! You must be relatively mobile to capitalize on their speed and maneuverability: all attacks and parries take a penalty equal to your encumbrance level (e.g., Heavy encumbrance gives -3 to hit or to parry). The skills in this category default to one another at -3. They also default to sword skills, as noted below. Main-Gauche (DX/Average): Any weapon normally wielded with Knife or Jitte/Sai skill (see below), used in the "off" hand. With this skill, you may ignore the penalty for using the "off" hand on defense (attacks are still at -4) and the -1 for parrying with a knife. To wield a knife as a primary weapon, use Knife skill. Defaults: Jitte/Sai-4 or Knife-4. Rapier (DX/Average): Any long (over 1 yard), light thrusting sword. Default: Broadsword-4. Saber (DX/Average): Any light cutand-thrust sword. Note that cavalry sabers are quite heavy, and use Broadsword instead. Defaults: Broadsword-4 or Shortsword-4. Smallsword (DX/Average): Any short (up to 1 yard), light thrusting sword or one-handed short staff (such as the sticks used in the martial arts arnis, escrima, and kali). Default: Shortsword-4. Flails A flail is any flexible, unbalanced weapon with its mass concentrated in the head. Such a weapon cannot parry if you have already attacked with it on your turn. Because flails tend to wrap around the target's shield or weapon, attempts to block them are at -2 and attempts to parry them are at -4. Fencing weapons and knives cannot parry them at all! An unarmed fighter can parry a flail, but at -4 in addition to any penalty for parrying unarmed. The skills in this category default to one another at -3. Flail (DX/Hard): Any one-handed flail, such as a morningstar or nunchaku. Default: Axe/Mace-4. Two-Handed Flail (DX/Hard): Any two-handed flail. Defaults: Kusari-4 or Two-Handed Axe/Mace-4. Impact Weapons An impact weapon is any rigid, unbalanced weapon with most of its mass concentrated in the head. Such a weapon cannot parry if you have already attacked with it on your turn. The skills in this category default to one another at -3. Axe/Mace (DX/Average): Any shortor medium-length, one-handed impact weapon, such as an axe, hatchet, knobbed club, or pick. Default: Flail-4. Two-Handed Axe/Mace impact weapon, such as a baseball bat, battleaxe, maul, or warhammer. Defaults: Polearm-4 or Two-Handed Flail-4. Pole Weapons Pole weapons are long (usually wooden) shafts, often adorned with striking heads. All require two hands. Polearm (DX/Average): Any very long weapon with a heavy striking head, including the glaive, halberd, poleaxe, and countless others. Polearms become unready after an attack, but not after a parry. Defaults: Spear-4, Staff-4, or TwoHanded Axe/Mace-4. Spear (DX/Average): Any long, balanced pole weapon with a thrusting point, including spears, javelins, tridents, and fixed bayonets. Defaults: Polearm-4 or Staff-2. Staff (DX/Average): Any long, balanced pole without a striking head. This skill makes good use of the staff's extensive parrying surface when defending, giving +2 to your Parry score. Defaults: Polearm-4 or Spear-2. Swords A sword is a rigid, hilted blade with a thrusting point, cutting edge, or both. All swords are balanced, and can attack and parry without becoming unready. Broadsword (DX/Average): Any balanced, 2to 4-foot blade wielded in one hand â€“ broadsword, cavalry saber, scimitar, etc. This skill also covers any stick or club of similar size and balance to these blades, as well as bastard swords, katanas, and longswords used one-handed. Defaults: Force Sword-4, Rapier-4, Saber-4, Shortsword-2, or Two-Handed Sword-4. Force Sword (DX/Average): Any sword with a "blade" made of energy instead of matter. This generally refers to an ultra-tech weapon that projects energy from a powered hilt, but extends to similar effects produced using magic or psionics. Default: any sword skill at -3. Jitte/Sai (DX/Average): Any tined, one-handed sword designed to catch rigid weapons. Jitte/Sai weapons are built for disarming, and give +2 in the Quick Contest to disarm an opponent Furthermore, if you attempt to disarm on the turn immediately after you parry your opponent's weapon, you need not roll to hit his weapon first. Just state that you are attempting to disarm and move directly to the Quick Contest! This still counts as an attack. Defaults: Force Sword-4, MainGauche-4, or Shortsword-3. Knife (DX/Easy): Any rigid, hilted blade less than one foot long, from a pocketknife to a bowie knife. A knife has a very small parrying surface, which gives you -1 to your Parry score. Defaults: Force Sword-3, MainGauche-3, or Shortsword-3. Shortsword (DX/Average): Any balanced, one-handed weapon 1-2 feet in length â€“ including the shortsword and any club of comparable size and balance (e.g., a police baton). Defaults: Broadsword-2, Force Sword-4, Jitte/Sai-3, Knife-4, Saber-4, Smallsword-4, or Tonfa-3. Two-Handed Sword (DX/Average): Any balanced, two-handed blade over 4 feet in length: greatswords, zweihanders, etc. This skill also covers quarterstaffs wielded like swords, as well as bastard swords, katanas, and longswords used two-handed. Defaults: Broadsword-4 or Force Sword-4. Whips A whip is a flexible weapon made from a length of chain, leather, wire, etc. A whip can be up to seven yards long â€“ but note that a whip two yards or more in length cannot strike at one yard or closer, and is slow to ready after an attack. A whip tends to wind around its target, making it an excellent disarming and entangling weapon. However, a whip's lack of rigidity makes it a poor parrying weapon. For details, see Special Melee Weapon Rules (p. 404). The skills in this category default to one another at -3. Force Whip (DX/Average): Any whip made of pure energy instead of matter. These are usually ultra-tech devices that project energy from a powered hilt, but magical or psi-tech versions are possible. Most force whips can lash the target but not ensnare him. Kusari (DX/Hard): A weighted chain wielded in two hands. Default: Two-Handed Flail-4. Monowire Whip (DX/Hard): A whip made of a weighted length of monomolecular wire attached to a handle. Whip (DX/Average): Any ordinary whip. Other Weapons Some hand weapons defy easy classification. For instance: Tonfa (DX/Average): A tonfa is a baton with a protruding handle on one side. It can function as a baton, but you can also grasp it by the handle and hold it against the forearm in close combat. This grip lets you jab for thrust+1 crushing damage and parry close-combat attacks at (skill/2) + 3, rounded down. Roll vs. skill to change grips. On a success, the grip change is a free action. On a failure, you must spend the entire turn changing grips. A critical failure means you throw your weapon away! Default: Shortsword-3.</desc>

Make a skill roll to judge the value of any piece of common goods, find out where any commodity is bought and sold, find the local fair market value of any commodity, etc. When two merchants haggle, the GM may settle it with a Quick Contest. The winner adds or subtracts 10% of fair value, depending on whether he was trying to sell or buy. If you have this skill at any level, you get +1 on reaction rolls when buying or selling. If you have this skill at level 20 or better, you get +2. Modifiers: -3 for Gullibility (p. 137); Shyness (p. 154). -3 for illegal goods, unless you have Streetwise at 12+ or specialize in such goods; -2 in an unfamiliar area, until you have had time to familiarize yourself with local market conditions; Cultural Familiarity modifiers (p. 23).

				<desc>This is the study of the weather, and the ability to predict it. It includes familiarity with technological aids such as barometers and satellite maps, but you can still function without your instruments. (If you can't, you're a meter-reader, not a meteorologist!) When you wish to predict the weather, the GM rolls against your skill in secret. On a success, he tells the truth; on a failure, he answers randomly, or lies. Each skill roll predicts the weather for one day. If one day's roll fails, subsequent ones can't succeed. For instance, a three-day forecast would require three skill rolls: the first for tomorrow, the second for the next day, and the third for the day after that. A successful roll also allows you to deduce what sort of general climate to expect when you visit a new area. At TL4 or less, this skill is called Weather Sense, and you get +2 to skill in your home area. At TL5 and up, Meteorology is a scientific skill, and you must specialize by planet type; see Planet Types (p. 180) for details. Modifiers: Time is a major factor! There is no penalty to predict tomorrow's weather, but you have -1 for 2 days, -2 for 3 days, -4 for 4 days, -6 for 5 days, and an additional -2 per day for each further day. Instrumentation becomes useful with the development of the barometer at TL4, after which equipment modifiers (p. 345) apply.

To fool people, you must win a Quick Contest of Mimicry vs. the listeners' Naturalist-3 or Perception-6. Default: Naturalist-6. Bird Calls: Allows you to reproduce the whistles, chirps, and other sounds made by birds. Otherwise, this works as Animal Sounds. Default: Naturalist-6. Speech: Enables you to imitate vocal sounds.

The techniques involved are wholly mundane â€“ for instance, doing complicated mathematical calculations, or repeating poetry over and over again. With sufficient training, anyone can learn this skill. To maintain a block, you must make a Mind Block roll once per minute. You must roll every second in combat or other stressful situations. If you succeed, anyone who reads your mind must win a Quick Contest of his mind-reading ability vs. your Mind Block skill in order to get useful information. Otherwise, he gets nothing but poetry, multiplication tables, etc. However, if you ever critically fail a Mind Block roll, you thought about precisely what the mind reader wanted to know â€“ in detail â€“ right there in the forefront of your mind! This skill only works against mind reading, not mind control or other mental attacks. If you have a supernatural mind shield, Mind Block acts as a last-ditch defense: only mental probes that pierce your magical or psionic defenses and contact your mind will encounter the block. Modifiers: +2 if you do nothing but concentrate on blocking; -3 if you are mentally or physically stunned; -2 or more to hide emotions rather than thoughts, depending on how strong the GM rules your emotions are â€“ it's hard to block your emotions while sneaking up on your most hated enemy!</desc>

				<desc>This is the ability to compose a piece of music. A successful skill roll means the piece is a pleasant listening experience. To compose for an ensemble or band without a conductor, you must have a skill level of IQ with at least one instrument in the composition and a skill level of IQ-2 with the rest. Roll at first used in the piece; e.g., a jazz composition for a saxophone section, drums, and bass would require a roll at -2. To compose for an orchestra or band with a conductor requires Group Performance (Conducting) skill eral class of instruments after the first used in the piece. Classes include brass, percussion, strings, and woodwinds. Treat choir, harp, organ, or piano as its own class. This skill includes the ability to read, write, and transcribe music in your culture's notation system (if any). Treat different systems â€“ and different musical traditions â€“ as familiarities</desc>

				<desc>Prerequisites: Musical Ability 1 and either Musical Instrument or Singing at 12+. This cinematic skill allows you to influence the emotions of others by playing a musical instrument or singing. In some settings, this is a magical or psionic talent, or a special form of hypnotism, and works with any instrument, as well as with voice. In other settings, this skill is associated with a specific type of magical or ultra-tech instrument. To attempt Musical Influence, you must first get your audience to sit and listen to your performance. You must also make a successful Musical Instrument or Singing roll. You may then roll against your Musical Influence skill. On a success, you can adjust the reaction roll of your audience â€“ to you or to anyone present â€“ up or down by an amount equal to your margin of success, to a maximum of +3 (+4 for critical success). If you have only a few seconds, or if the audience is not paying full attention to your performance, you may adjust reaction rolls by Â±1 at most, regardless of your margin of success. Listeners who do not wish to be influenced may resist with Will. Hard of Hearing (p. 138) gives +4 to resist, and those with Deafness (p. 129) are completely immune. However, some science-fiction devices generate vibrations that affect the body, in which case a listener's sense of hearing is irrelevant. It is up to the GM to determine whether this skill works on animals as well as sapient beings. In classic fantasy, it just might!</desc>

Modifiers: +3 if you have Absolute Direction (p. 34), or a high-tech global positioning system or inertial compass; -5 (and no use of Astronomy default) if you lack hightech aids, the weather is bad, and the stars are hidden. Defaults: Astronomy-5 or Seamanship-5. Air: Navigation by the stars and by the terrain below. Modifiers are as for Navigation (Sea). Default: Astronomy-5. Land: Navigation using landmarks and the stars; also called "orienteering." Modifiers: +3 if you have Absolute Direction or a high-tech substitute. Defaults: IQ-5, Cartography-4, or Mathematics Space: Navigating through ordinary interplanetary and interstellar space, usually at less than the speed of light (but some science-fiction than-light speeds in normal space). Modifiers: +2 for 3D Spatial Sense Mathematics (Applied)-4. Hyperspace: Also called "astrogation." Similar to Navigation (Space), but used when traveling through tings with multiple faster-than-light drive technologies, there may be one Navigation specialty per drive type. Modifiers are as for Navigation Mathematics (Applied)-4. Air, Land, and Sea default to one another at -2. Space and Hyperspace default to one another at -5. There are no defaults between these two groups. Modifiers: -1 to -10 for being in an unfamiliar area (GM's discretion, but an unfamiliar world, star system, etc. should give at least -5); equipment modifiers (p. 345).</desc>

Use this skill to monitor a location, a group of people, or your immediate surroundings for concealed or tactically significant details. This is not the same as gathering clues or making a hands-on search (use Forensics and Search, respectively) â€“ you always use Observation from a distance. A successful skill roll lets you gather information that is not specifically hidden. For instance, you could case a bank for obvious cameras before a robbery, learn the schedule of sentries, estimate the size of a crowd, or gauge the strength of troops moving in the open. The GM may require an Intelligence Analysis roll to interpret what you observe. To spot deliberately hidden details you, an armed man hiding in the crowd, or a concealed machine-gun nest â€“ you must win a Quick Contest of Observation skill vs. the Stealth, Shadowing, or Camouflage skill (as appropriate) of the other party. The GM should roll the Contest in secret, and should not say, "You don't see the machine gun nest concealed in the bushes." If your attempt fails, you get no details on an obvious item, or fail to spot a hidden one. On a critical failure, someone spots you and reacts poorly to the attention . . . Modifiers: Acute Senses (p. 35), as appropriate; modifiers for cover, darkness, or size; -1 to -10 if the target is concealed by high-tech camouflage or "stealth" technology; +1 to lance devices (a thermograph to spot a concealed sniper, binoculars to observe troop movements, etc.) and succeed at the skill roll to operate them.</desc>

A good roll might provide insights into phenomena that aren't related to known powers. However, Occultism provides no details on how talented individuals invoke their powers. For instance, a fantasy occultist would know what magic can accomplish, and could provide advice on slaying demons, but without Thaumatology skill (p. 225), he could not explain the gestures, words, and symbols used by wizards. In campaigns where many supernatural forces coexist, the GM may require occultists to specialize in such fields as Demonology (the study of demons, possession, and pacts), Pneumatology (the study of spirits), and Vampirology (the study of vampires).</desc>

Roll against Piloting for takeoffs and landings, and in any hazardous situation. Failure by 1 indicates a rough job; failure by more indicates damage to the vehicle. A critical failure is a crash! If you have skill 15+, a critical failure requires an immediate second roll. Only if the second roll is a failure does a mishap occur. Otherwise, it was a "near thing," averted by experience. Air combat requires frequent Piloting rolls as well. Make an IQ-based Piloting roll for basic map reading or practical meteorology, or to recall aviation laws and regulations. Remotely piloted vehicles (RPVs) use this skill if the pilot uses some form of telepresence to mimic actually being in the cockpit.

A successful skill roll lets you (among other things) recognize a poison-bearing plant in the wild; extract the poison in a useful form; recognize a poison by its taste in food or drink; identify a poison by observing its effects (+3 if you are poisoned); know a proper antidote; or recognize or prepare the antidote from its sources. Each of these feats requires a separate roll. Modifiers: Acute Taste and Smell ognize a poison by taste or by scent. Likewise, Discriminatory Smell and Discriminatory Taste (p. 49) give +4 to these tasks when working by smell or by taste, respectively.</desc>

You can only learn Politics in office or by working for someone in office. A successful skill roll will give you +2 on reactions from fellow politicians.

				<desc>Prerequisites: Trained By A Master or Weapon Master. This is the ability to draw on your inner strength to deliver a devastating blow in melee combat. Roll once per attack. Power Blow costs 1 FP per attempt, successful or not. If successful, double your ST for damage purposes for the next attack only. This attack takes all normal modifiers, and must occur immediately after the Power Blow roll. If you know Power Blow at better than skill 20, you can triple your ST by accepting an extra -10 to the skill roll. You can also use this skill in noncombat situations. For instance, you could use Power Blow to double or triple your ST momentarily in order to move a heavy object. Such feats cost 1 FP and require a skill roll, as described above. Modifiers: -10 if used instantly, dropping to -5 after 1 turn of concentration, -4 after 2 turns, -3 after 4 turns, -2 after 8 turns, -1 after 16 turns, and no penalty after 32 turns.</desc>

				<desc>This is the art of striking pressure points in order to disable an opponent. To use this ability, you must make a successful attack with Karate (or other appropriate combat skill; see below). This attack is at -2 in addition to any hit location modifier (see Hit Location, p. 398). If at least one point of damage penetrates the target’s DR, roll a Quick Contest of Pressure Points vs. the victim’s HT. If you win, you temporarily disable your target. A limb is paralyzed and effectively crippled for 5d seconds. A hit to a torso pressure point interferes with the victim’s breathing, resulting in suffocation (see Suffocation, p. 436); he may roll against HT every second to recover. A hit to the face stuns the victim; he gets an IQ roll every second to recover. A blow to the skull blinds the victim for 2d seconds; see Blindness (p. 124). You can also use Pressure Points with Judo. Roll the Quick Contest described above after successfully applying a lock. This is in addition to any other effects of the lock. The GM may permit warriors to learn specialties of this skill for use with crushing weapons. Examples include Pressure Points (Bow) for use with blunt arrows, Pressure Points (Shortsword) for use with a baton, and Pressure Points (Staff) for use with a staff. Modifiers: Physiology modifiers (p. 181).</desc>

				<desc>Prerequisites: Trained By A Master and Pressure Points at 16+. This skill represents knowledge of the most vulnerable vital points of the human body. It allows you to maim and kill by crushing and tearing vital organs and nerve clusters with deadly precision. To use this ability, you must make a successful unarmed attack. This attack is at -2 in addition to any hit location modifier (see Hit Location, p. 398). If you hit, make a Pressure Secrets roll. On a success, any damage that penetrates DR is doubled – or tripled if you targeted the vital organs. In effect, your hands and feet have become impaling weapons! You can also use this ability with locks and similar grappling attacks. This represents knowledge of exactly where to apply pressure to tear or sprain joints and ligaments. After applying the lock, make a Pressure Secrets roll. On a success, double the damage, shock, or harmful effects of the lock for that turn. This skill is unrealistic and potentially unbalancing. The GM should carefully weigh its impact before allowing it, and may wish to make it very difficult for PCs to learn – or even restrict it to deadly NPC opponents.

				<desc>Many realistic job skills are more useful for making a living than for adventuring. Most such skills do not appear in this skill list – but you can still learn them if you want! Each is a separate Professional Skill. If your “adventuring” skills aren’t useful for earning money, a Professional Skill can help you earn a steady income. To qualify for most jobs, you will need the relevant Professional Skill at 12+ (unless you are supposed to be incompetent!). SKILLS 215 Most professions encompass a body of knowledge. The associated Professional Skills are IQ/Average and default to IQ-5, because the smarter you are, the better you can recall and employ the techniques used at your job. Examples include air traffic controller, barber, brewer, cooper, distiller, dyer, florist, game designer, journalist, prostitute, tanner, vintner, and zookeeper. A few professions – glassblower, tailor, weaver, etc. – focus more on precision than on recall. These Professional Skills are DX/Average and default to DX-5. At the GM’s option, a given Professional Skill might also default to other skills. For instance, “Journalist” would logically default to Writing-3. The skills associated with highly paid or respected professions often have prerequisites. For instance, “Air Traffic Controller” might require Electronics Operation (Sensors) skill. Like defaults, prerequisites are up to the GM. You are free to create your own Professional Skills, subject to GM approval. They should be unique and well defined, not just a compilation of existing skills. For example: Bartender IQ/Average Defaults: IQ-5 or Carousing-3. This is the skill of maintaining a professional-quality bar and interacting with customers in a professional yet friendly way. A successful skill roll lets you mix drinks, recall local laws regarding alcohol, gauge the intoxication level of a customer, or calm an unruly drunk before the bouncer needs to get involved. At higher levels, this skill takes on an element of showmanship, allowing you to present drinks in unique and attractive ways, and to mix them with showy tricks and flourishes.</desc>

This counts as a barehanded attack (see Shove, p. 372), and your target may attempt any legal active defense. If you hit, use the higher of your ST or your Push skill as your effective ST. Roll swing damage for that ST, and double the result. For instance, if you had ST 10 and Push-15, you would roll swing damage for ST 15 (2d+1), and double it.

You may also substitute an Influence roll against Savoir-Faire for any reaction roll required in a social situation involving that subculture; see Influence Rolls (p. 359). Roll once per encounter. You must specialize. Common specialties include: Dojo: How to greet masters, wear weapons, and issue challenges at a karate dojo, kung fu kwoon, fencing salle, or similar academy of the martial arts. Recognized skill determines relative standing. In certain places and times, to flout tradition is to risk violent retribution! For competitive martial arts (only), this skill defaults to any relevant Games skill at -3. High Society: The manners of those of “good” birth and breeding. Status determines relative standing. Roll against skill whenever you must impersonate someone more than three Status levels away from your own. If your Status is negative and you are trying to pass yourself off as someone of Status 1+, or vice versa, this roll is at -2. Mafia: Proper conduct within a formal criminal organization. This includes such things as codes of silence and showing proper deference to “made men.” These protocols often ape those of high society . . . but the penalties for misconduct are far more severe. Default: Streetwise-3. Military: The customs, traditions, and regulations of military service. This also includes knowledge of the unwritten rules: what is acceptable even if not regulation, and what is forbidden although there is nothing in writing against it. Military Rank determines relative standing. Police: As Savoir-Faire (Military), but for civilian police service. This gives knowledge of the social protocols for police officers; use Law (Police) for the legal protocols. Police Rank determines relative standing. Servant: Knowledge of how to serve the upper class. Certain procedures are always done just so (the salad fork goes outside the dinner fork, the Duke is announced before the Earl, etc.), and certain attitudes in a servant are unacceptable. Savoir-Faire (High Society) is the most common specialty, and you may list this as simply “Savoir-Faire” on your character sheet. Savoir Faire (High Society) and (Servant) default to one another at -2. There are no defaults between other types of Savoir-Faire. Modifiers: Cultural Familiarity modifiers (p. 23). +2 if you are of higher standing than those you are trying to impress, or -2 if you are of lower standing (“standing” might mean Rank, Status, skill level, or something else). +2 if you seem to have important friends. -4 for Clueless (p. 126); -3 for Low Empathy (p. 142); -1 for Oblivious (p. 146); -1 to -4 for Shyness (p. 154).</desc>

For deliberately concealed items, this is a Quick Contest of your Search skill vs. the Holdout or Smuggling skill used to hide the item. If you fail, the GM simply says, "You found nothing." (It defeats the purpose to say, jacket.") If more than one person is searching, roll separately for each searcher. The GM should avoid unnecessary rolls. For instance, no human can get a sawed-off shotgun through a body search. Likewise, a knife or jewel simply cannot be found on a normally dressed person without an X-ray or skin search. In general, if the net bonus to the concealer's Holdout roll is +3 or more, a skin search is required. If his Holdout is at -2 or worse for size, a skin search will automatically find the hidden item.

Use the same rules, but you roll at -2 (and may not use your Stealth default). Modifiers: -3 if the subject knows you. Distinctive appearance gives a penalty – see Build (p. 18), Unnatural Features (p. 22), and specific disadvantages (e.g., Hunchback, p. 139) for details. If you belong to a visibly different race than most of the people around you, the penalty is up to the GM; it is never smaller in magnitude than the difference between your Size Modifier and that of those around you.</desc>

				<desc>Prerequisites: see below. This is the ability to act as the master of a large vessel. It involves directing the crew in the tasks necessary to control the vehicle's speed and direction. It also covers such duties as keeping the captain's log and inspecting the crew. Someone with Shiphandling skill (at better than default!) should stand watch at all times when the vessel is underway. Roll vs. skill when encountering hazards or maneuvering for battle. A failed roll when encountering hazards means the vessel is damaged. This might mean anything from scratched paint to crippling damage that requires extensive repairs. A failed roll in battle means the vessel did not go exactly where intended. The details depend on the vessel, the tech level, and the GM's judgment, but might include weapons being enemy), a failed boarding attempt, or drifting out of formation with your fleet (which might deny you the benefits of area defenses, fire support, or tactical communications). Whether they then save your ship for you, or mutiny and flee, is up to the GM. You must specialize: Airship: Blimps, zeppelins, and similar large airships. Prerequisites: Airshipman, Leadership, and Navigation (Air). Defaults: Airshipman-5 or Piloting (LighterThan-Air)-5. Ship: Surface vessels, from tugboats to carriers. Prerequisites: Leadership, Navigation (Sea), and Seamanship. Defaults: Seamanship-5, or to Boating (Large Powerboat)-5 for ships with engines or Boating Spaceship: Slower-than-light spacecraft. Prerequisites: Leadership, Navigation (Space), and Spacer. Defaults: Spacer-5 or any spaceship Piloting-5. Starship: Faster-than-light spacecraft. Prerequisites: Leadership, Navigation (Hyperspace), and Spacer. Defaults: Spacer-5 or any spaceship Piloting-5. Submarine: All forms of large submersibles. Prerequisites: Leadership, Navigation (Sea), and Submariner. Defaults: Submariner-5 or Submarine Modifiers: -2 to master an unfamiliar vessel (e.g., an aircraft carrier when you're used to a battleship); -2 for an unfamiliar crew; -2 or more for a vehicle in bad repair.</desc>

				<desc>This skill represents a combination of basic military training â€“ the lessons taught at "boot camp" or its equivalent in your game world â€“ and actual combat experience. Only those who have served in an army, militia, etc. are likely to know it. The GM may require a Soldier roll whenever circumstances would test your battlefield discipline (knowing when to shoot, use concealment, take cover, etc.) or skill at practical field survival (e.g., keeping your feet dry and eating when you get the chance). Roll daily during prolonged military action. Failure means an inconvenience â€“ perhaps a minor piece of equipment fails. Critical failure indicates a disaster: "friendly fire" incident, trench foot, etc. Soldier includes basic lessons in many fields covered by other skills. For instance, a TL8 soldier learns to strip his rifle without learning Armoury (Small Arms), to use a radio without learning Electronics Operation (Comm), to dig a foxhole without learning Engineer (Combat), and so forth. In a situation where someone with one of those skills would roll at +4 or better for a routine task (see Task Difficulty, p. 345), the GM may let you roll against Soldier skill instead. You do not receive the bonus that someone with the fullfledged skill would get, but you do suffer any situational penalties. Soldier can only substitute for skill rolls to do things that would be a believable part of basic training. This means the routine use of standard equipment by ordinary troops â€“ not research, improvisation, or design, and never the operation of new or secret technologies! Soldier cannot replace weapon skills, either; you must buy all such skills separately. Example: If someone with Electronics Operation (Comm) would be at +4 to call HQ on a standard-issue radio, you could do so with a successful Soldier roll. However, you could not use Soldier to fix a broken radio, use an enemy radio, or transmit coded signals.</desc>

				<desc>This is the ability to “live off the land,” find safe food and water, avoid hazards, build shelter, etc. You may look after up to 10 other people. To live safely in a wilderness situation, you must make a successful Survival roll once per day. Failure inflicts 2d-4 injury on you and anyone in your care; roll separately for each victim. This skill also gives an “eye for country.” A successful roll shows you the best direction of travel to find flowing water, a mountain pass, or whatever other terrain feature you desire – assuming that it exists. Finally, you can use this skill to trap wild animals. (A city-bred thief could use Traps skill, but he’s used to different game . . . so the roll would be at a -5.) Make one roll per trap. It takes about 30 minutes to improvise a trap from ordinary materials, or 10 minutes to set and hide a commercial steel trap. Pit traps for large game take several hours to dig. Survival often requires skill rolls based on scores other than PercepSKILLS 223 tion. The GM might ask for a ST-based roll to dig a pit trap or erect a log shelter, a DX-based roll to start a fire using primitive techniques (flint sparking, bow and palette, etc.), or even a HTbased roll to avoid nutritional deficiencies from an improvised diet. You must specialize by terrain type. Land-dwellers may choose from Arctic, Desert, Island/Beach, Jungle, Mountain, Plains, Swampland, and Woodlands. Aquatic beings may take any of Bank, Deep Ocean Vent, FreshWater Lake, Open Ocean, Reef, River/Stream, Salt-Water Sea, and Tropical Lagoon. Amphibious individuals can pick from either list! Land specialties default to one another at -3, while aquatic specialties default among themselves at -4. Island/Beach and Tropical Lagoon default to each other at -4, as do Swampland and River/Stream, but there are no other defaults between land and aquatic specialties. In settings where it is possible to visit other worlds, you must also specialize by planet. Each Survival specialty defaults to the same terrain type for a different planet at -4. The defaults between terrain types given above are at an extra -4 between different planets. All this assumes the two planets are of the same planet type (see Planet Types, p. 180). There is no default at all between Survival skills for two planets of different planet types. At the GM’s option, extreme manmade terrain may call for unique specialties; e.g., Survival (Radioactive Wasteland). Most such specialties have no default of any kind.

On a success, add half your margin of success (round down) to your skill with the next ritual you conduct over the symbols. This kind of Symbol Drawing defaults to Ritual Magic Drawing (Voodoo) defaults to Ritual Magic (Voodoo)-4, and lets you draw the vevers used in Voodoo ritual. In traditions where the symbols themselves imbue items or places (or even people, in the case of tattoos) with magic, the magic is only as good as the symbols. Roll against the lower of Symbol Drawing and your skill with the enchantment itself. This is most common in rune magic. Each runic alphabet is a separate Symbol Drawing skill with no default. For instance, Symbol Drawing (Futhark Runes) would let you scribe the runes used in Norse magic. More-exotic traditions may have their own rules; see the appropriate worldbook for more information. Modifiers: -1 or more if using nontraditional means to mark the symbols; -1 or more if placing the symbols on any surface other than those prescribed by your tradition.</desc>

				<desc>This is the ability to outguess and outmaneuver the enemy in small-unit or personal combat. In most settings, only the military teaches this skill. When commanding a small unit, roll against Tactics to place your troops correctly for an ambush, know where to post sentries, etc. At the GM's option, a successful roll might even provide clues as to immediate enemy plans. To outmaneuver enemy units, you must win a Quick Contest of Tactics with their leader. All of this only applies when you lead a group small enough that you can give each warrior orders personally â€“ or through at most one subordinate. Thus, radio and similar technologies can greatly enhance your command abilities! In personal combat, you may make a Tactics roll before the fight begins if you had any time to prepare. On a success, you start the fight in an advantageous position â€“ e.g., behind cover or on higher ground â€“ as determined by the GM. The better the roll, the greater your advantage. If you fail, or do not attempt a Tactics roll, you are in a random location (or one of the GM's choosing) when combat begins. Fighters without Tactics skill always start combat this way. Even in an ambush or similar "surprise" situation, the GM will use the better of your Tactics skill and your Perception to see if you spotted the danger on time.</desc>

				<desc>This is the skill of driving a team of animals pulling a wagon, chariot, etc. It includes the ability to harness and care for the beasts, and judge them for quality before purchase. If the animals are ornery or badly trained (GM’s judgment), you must make a success- ful Animal Handling roll before you can attempt a Teamster roll. For normal travel, make a Teamster roll once per day. When moving at a gallop (80% or more of the animals’ full Move) or when exe- cuting complex maneuvers with a chariot in combat, roll every 10 seconds. A failure usually means nothing worse than lost time or a wider turn than intended. A critical failure – or any failure at a gallop – spills the wagon or chariot. Treat this as a five- yard fall for each passenger and animal involved (see Falling, p. 431). As well, roll 2d for each beast; on a 12, a leg is broken! You will have to make Animal Handling rolls to calm the beasts. Time required to reload the cargo depends on the load, terrain, and weather. You must specialize by animal type; the most common specialty is Teamster (Equines), which covers horses and mules. Teamster special- ties default to one another at -3. Modifiers: -2 for more than four animals; -2 for a team of unfamiliar animals; up to -5 for bad terrain.</desc>

				<desc>This is the academic study of magical theory and the “physics” of mana. Anyone may learn this skill, but it is easier for a mage; add Magery to IQ when learning this skill, just as for spells. The main use for this skill is magical research. When creating a new spell, use the rules for inventing (see Chapter 17), but replace Engineer skill with Thaumatology. A successful skill roll can also identify an unknown spell when you see it cast, deduce the ramifications of a critical success or failure with magic, determine the spells needed to enchant a magic item to perform as desired, etc. The better your roll, the more insight the GM will provide. This is the study of fantasy magic – fireball spells, rings of power, etc. The equivalent skill for traditional, spiritmediated sorcery is Ritual Magic (p. 218), while holy magic might require Religious Ritual (p. 217) or Theology (p. 226). However, a Thaumatology roll at -5 will allow a thaumatologist to relate these different varieties of magic to “standard” wizardry. Exceptionally weird powers or otherworldly artifacts might give a larger penalty!</desc>

There are usually no defaults between specialties, but the GM might permit a default at -4 or so for belief systems that have similar origins, or where one is derived from the other. Alternatively, you may study the similarities and differences between religions; this is Theology (Comparative). The Theology of any religion routinely studied by scholars in your game world defaults to this specialty at -5. To be a priest or holy man at TL1+, you must have both Theology and Religious Ritual skill (p. 217) for your religion. TL0 shamans need only learn Religious Ritual. You do not necessarily believe in the religion you study – faith comes from within, not from book learning! If you do, you may ask the GM to make a secret roll against your Theology skill when confronted with moral uncertainty. On a success, the GM will advise you on which course of action “feels” right, given your beliefs and understanding of scripture.</desc>

				<desc>This is the ability to follow a man or an animal by its tracks. Make a Tracking roll to pick up the trail, then roll periodically to avoid losing it. The frequency and difficulty of these rolls depend on the terrain: Jungle, Plains, or Woodlands: Roll every 30 minutes. Arctic, Desert, Island/Beach, or Mountain: Roll at -2 every 15 minutes. Swampland: Roll at -4 every 5 minutes. Urban: Roll at -6 every minute! You may also use this skill to cover your tracks. This doubles your travel time! A successful roll means you have hidden your tracks well enough that only someone else with this skill can see them. If another tracker follows you, the Tracking rolls above become Quick Contests of Tracking skill. If he loses any of the Contests, he loses your trail. To stalk game once you have tracked it, use the Stealth skill (p. 222). Modifiers: -5 if the trail is more than a day old, or -10 if more than a week old. +3 if you are following a man, or +6 if following a group of men. Superior senses help a lot: bonuses for Acute Vision (p. 35) and Discriminatory Smell (p. 49) usually apply, and many superhuman senses (Infravision, Subsonic Hearing, etc.) give situational bonuses.</desc>
