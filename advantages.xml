				<name>360° Vision</name>
				<nums>31</nums>
				<stat>25 points</stat>
				<desc>You have a 360° field of vision. You have no penalty to defend against attacks from the sides or rear. You can attack foes to your sides or rear without making a Wild Swing, but you are at -2 to hit due to the clumsy angle of attack (note that some Karate techniques do not suffer this penalty). Finally, you are at +5 to detect Shadowing attempts, and are never surprised by a danger that comes from behind, unless it also is concealed from sight. Extra eyes are merely a special effect of this trait – you can have any number of eyes, but the point cost remains the same. Special Limitations Easy to Hit: Your eyes are on stalks, unusually large, or otherwise more vulnerable to attack. Others can target your eyes from within their arc of vision at only -6 to hit. -20%. 3D Spatial Sense see Absolute Direction</desc>

				<stat>5 or 10 points</stat>
				<desc>You have an excellent sense of direction. This ability comes in two levels: Absolute Direction: You always know which way is north, and you can always retrace a path you have followed within the past month, no matter how faint or confusing. This ability does not work in environments such as interstellar space or the limbo of the astral plane, but it does work underground, underwater, and on other planets. This gives +3 to Body Sense and Navigation (Air, Land, or Sea). (Note: The navigational sense that guides migratory creatures to their destination is too crude to qualify; treat it as a 0-point feature.) 5 points. 3D Spatial Sense: As above, but works in three dimensions. This ability is useful in deep space – although it does not help you if you travel across dimensions. You get the skill bonuses given for Absolute Direction, plus +1 to Piloting and +2 to Aerobatics, Free Fall, and Navigation (Hyperspace or Space). 10 points. Special Limitations Requires Signal: You rely on signals from a navigational satellite network Your ability does not function in the absence of such a system, and it can be jammed. -20%.</desc>

				<stat>2 or 5 points</stat>
				<desc>You have an accurate mental clock. This ability comes in two levels, both of which are somewhat cinematic: Absolute Timing: You always know what time it is, with a precision equal to the best personal timepieces widely available in your culture (but never better than a few seconds). You can measure elapsed time with equal accuracy. Neither changes of time zone nor sleep interferes with this ability, and you can wake up at a predetermined time if you choose. Being knocked unconscious, hypnotized, etc. may prevent this advantage from working, and time travel will confuse you until you find out what the “new” time is. 2 points. Chronolocation: As above, but time travel does not interfere – you always know what time it is in an absolute sense. Note that things like Daylight Savings Time and calendar reform can still confuse you! When you travel in time, the GM may tell you, “You have gone back exactly 92,876.3 days,” and let you – or your character – deal with questions like, “What about leap year?” 5 points.</desc>

				<desc>You have superior senses. Each Acute Sense is a separate advantage that gives +1 per level to all Sense rolls for you – using that one sense. Acute Hearing gives you a bonus to hear something, or to notice a sound ty off a gun in the dark). 2 points/level. Acute Taste and Smell gives you a bonus to notice a taste or smell (for instance, poison in your drink). 2 points/level. Acute Touch gives you a bonus to detect something by touch (for instance, a concealed weapon when patting down a suspect). 2 points/level. Acute Vision gives you a bonus to spot things visually, and whenever you do a visual search (for instance, looking for traps or footprints). 2 points/level. With the GM’s permission, you may also buy Acute Sense advantages for specialized senses such as Scanning Sense and Vibration Sense. You cannot usually buy Acute Senses in play – raise your Perception instead. However, if you lose a sense, the GM may allow you to spend earned points on other Acute Senses to compensate. For instance, if you are blinded, you might acquire Acute Hearing.</desc>

			<key>Affliction</key>
			<value>
				<name>Affliction</name>
				<nums>31</nums>
				<stat>10 points/level</stat>
				<desc>You have an attack that causes a baneful, nondamaging effect: blindness, paralysis, weakness, etc. This might be an ultra-tech beam weapon, a chemical spray, a supernatural gaze attack, or almost anything else. Specify the details when you buy the advantage. By default, Affliction is a ranged attack with 1/2D 10, Max 100, Acc 3, RoF 1, Shots N/A, and Recoil 1, although you can apply modifiers to change these statistics (see pp. 101116). If you hit, your victim gets a HT+1 roll to resist. Apply a penalty equal to the level of the Affliction (so Affliction 1 gives an unmodified HT roll). The victim gets a bonus equal to his DR unless the Affliction has one of the following modifiers: Blood Agent, Contact Agent, Cosmic, Follow-Up, Malediction, Respiratory Agent or Sense-Based. To reduce the effects of DR, add the Armor Divisor enhancement. The victim gets a further +3 if he is beyond 1/2D range. If the victim makes his HT roll, he is unaffected. If he fails, he suffers the effects of the Affliction. By default, he is stunned (see p. 420). He may roll vs. HT+1 once per second to recover, but once again at a penalty equal to the level of the Affliction (DR has no effect on this roll). If your Affliction causes an effect other than stunning, this is a special enhancement (see below). You can inflict more than one effect by giving your Affliction multiple special enhancements. These effects occur simultaneously, except where noted. Successive Afflictions that produce the same effects are not normally cumulative. Use the single worst effect. Use the special enhancements below to create specific Afflictions. Many Attack Enhancements and Limitations (p. 102) are also logical. For instance, a blinding flash is SenseBased (p. 109); most drugs have Follow-Up (p. 105), Blood Agent supernatural attacks like the “evil eye” use Malediction (p. 106); and touch attacks call for Melee Attack (p. 112). If an Affliction produces two or more effects due to the special enhancements below, some of these effects may be secondary. Secondary effects occur only if the victim fails his HT roll by 5 or more or rolls a critical failure. A secondary effect is worth 1/5 as much; e.g., Secondary Heart Attack is +60% rather than +300%. Once you have chosen all the modifiers on your Affliction, describe the nature of the attack as detailed for Innate Attack (p. 61). supernatural traits are allowed – and to whom – in his campaign. Special Enhancements Advantage: The victim immediately experiences the effects of a specific physical or mental advantage. Advantages with instantaneous effects affect the target once, as soon as he is hit, if he fails his HT roll; e.g., Warp immediately teleports the subject. Advantages that can be switched on and off (such as Insubstantiality) are automatically “on” for one minute per point by which the victim fails his HT roll, and are not under the subject’s control. This is worth +10% per point the advantage is worth; e.g., Insubstantiality would be +800%! If the advantage comes in levels, specify the level. Attribute Penalty: The victim suffers temporary attribute loss. This is +5% per -1 to ST or HT, or +10% per -1 to DX or IQ. For instance, an attack that caused DX-3 and IQ-2 would be +50%. Lower all skills based on reduced attributes by a like amount. ST penalties also reduce BL and damage, while IQ reductions also apply to Will and Perception. Secondary characteristics are not otherwise affected; for instance, HT reduction does not affect Basic Speed or FP. Penalties last for one minute per point by which the victim fails his HT roll. Coma: The victim collapses, profoundly unconscious, and will likely die in days unless treated; see Mortal Conditions (p. 429). +250%. Cumulative: Repeated attacks are cumulative! You must take this in conjunction with Attribute Penalty, or with an Advantage, Disadvantage, or Negated Advantage Enhancement that inflicts a “leveled” trait. +400%. Disadvantage: The victim temporarily gains one or more specific physical or mental disadvantages (but not self-imposed mental disadvantages – see p. 121). This is worth +1% per point the temporary disadvantages are worth; e.g., Paranoia [-10] is worth +10%. If a disadvantage comes in levels, specify the level. The disadvantages last for one minute per point by which the victim fails his HT roll. Heart Attack: The victim suffers an incapacitating heart attack, and will die in minutes unless treated; see Mortal Conditions (p. 429). +300%. Incapacitation: The victim is incapacitated for a number of minutes equal to the margin of failure on his HT roll. After that, he is stunned until he can make a HT roll (roll once per second). If you combine Incapacitation with other effects (such as Irritant), those effects occur after the Incapacitation wears off; they replace the stunning and last for the same length of time the Incapacitation did. Incapacitation can take the form of any of the following: Daze, +50%; Hallucinating, +50%; Retching, +50%; Agony, +100%; Choking, +100%; Ecstasy, +100%; Seizure, +100%; Paralysis, +150%; Sleep, +150%; or Unconsciousness, +200%. See Incapacitating Conditions (p. 428) for the game effects. Irritant: The victim suffers an impairing but non-incapacitating condition instead of being stunned. It lasts for a number of minutes equal to the margin of failure on his HT roll. The possibilities are Tipsy +10%; Coughing, +20%; Drunk, +20%; Moderate Pain, +20%; Euphoria, initions, see Irritating Conditions Negated Advantage: The victim loses a specific advantage for one minute per point by which he failed his HT roll. There is no effect if the victim lacks that advantage! This enhancement is worth +1% per point the advantage is worth. If the advantage comes in levels, you must specify the level negated. Stunning: May only accompany Advantage, Attribute Penalty, Disadvantage, or Negated Advantage. If the victim fails to resist, he is stunned tion to the effects of the other enhancement(s). +10%.</desc>

			<key>Allies</key>

				<name>Allies</name>
				<nums>4</nums>
				<stat>Variable</stat>
				<desc>Many fictional heroes have partners – loyal comrades, faithful sidekicks, trusted retainers, or lifelong friends – who accompany them on adventures. These partners are The other PCs in your adventuring party are, in a sense, “allies.” But they can be unreliable allies indeed. Often they are chance acquaintances, first encountered at a roadside tavern only hours ago. They have their own hidden goals, ethics, and motives, which might not coincide with your own. An NPC Ally, on the other hand, is wholly reliable. Perhaps you fought side by side in a long war, trained under the same master, or grew up in the same village. The two of you trust each other implicitly. You travel together, fight back-to-back, share rations in hard times, and trade watches through the night. An Ally may try to dissuade you from a plan that seems foolish to him – and if he can’t talk you out of the plan, he may refuse to cooperate. An Ally may even cause problems for you: picking fights, landing in jail, insulting a high noble . . . Of course, the Ally will also try to bail you out when you make mistakes. The GM will not award you bonus character points for any play session in which you betray, attack, or unnecessarily endanger your Ally. Blatant, prolonged, or severe betrayal will break the trust between you and your Ally, and he will leave you permanently. If you drive your Ally off in this way, the points you spent on him are gone, reducing your point value. Leading your Ally into danger is all right, as long as you face the same danger and are a responsible leader. The point cost for an Ally depends on his power and frequency of appearance. Only PCs who take NPCs as Allies pay points for the privilege. Two PCs can be mutual “allies” for free, as can two NPCs – and NPCs never pay points for PCs as Allies. An Ally is specifically a skilled NPC associate for one PC. Ally’s Power Consult the following table to determine how many points you must spend on your Ally. “Point Total” is the Ally’s point total expressed as a percentage of the PC’s starting points; Ally’s point total falls between two percentages, use the higher. Point Total Cost 25% 1 point 50% 2 points 75% 3 points 100% 5 points 150% 10 points Allies built on more than 150% of the PC’s starting points are not allowed; treat such NPCs as Patrons (see p. 72). Exception: The progression above extends indefinitely for nonsentient (IQ 0) Allies; each +50% of the PC’s starting points costs a further +5 points. Allies built on no more than 100% of the PC’s starting points may also be Dependents (see p. 131). Add the cost of Ally and Dependent together, and treat the combination as a single trait: an advantage if the total point cost is positive, a disadvantage if it is negative. Ally Groups You may purchase as many Allies as you can afford. Each Ally is normally a separate advantage, but you can treat a group of related Allies as a single trait to save space on your character sheet. For a group of individuals character sheets – add the costs of the individual Allies to find the cost of the group, adjust the total cost for frequency of appearance, and then apply any special modifiers. For a group of more than five identical and interchangeable allies that share a single character sheet – for instance, an army of low-grade thugs or a swarm of robot drones – find the point cost to have one member of the group as an Ally, and then multiply that cost as follows to find the cost of the group: Size of Group Multiplier 6-10 ¥6 11-20 ¥8 21-50 ¥10 51-100 ¥12 Add ¥6 to the multiplier per tenfold increase in number (e.g., 100,000 Allies would be ¥30). The GM may require an Unusual Background Allies, or even prohibit groups larger than a certain size – although he might permit an army or other large group as a Patron. Frequency of appearance multipliers and special modifiers (if any) apply to the final cost of the entire group. Frequency of Appearance Choose a frequency of appearance start of an adventure, he accompanies you for the duration of that adventure. Allies in Play As with Dependents (p. 131), the GM will adjust your Ally’s abilities in order to keep his point total a fixed percentage of your own as you earn points. This will keep his value as an advantage constant. The GM decides how the Ally evolves, although he might ask you for your input. If your Ally dies through no fault of yours, the GM will not penalize you. You may put the points spent on the deceased Ally toward a new Ally. The new relationship should normally develop gradually, but the GM might allow an NPC to become an Ally on the spot if you have done something that would win him over (e.g., saving his life). This is especially appropriate in cultures where debts of honor are taken seriously! There is no penalty for amicably parting ways with your Ally. You may use the points spent on him to buy a new Ally met during play. At the GM’s discretion, you may trade in any remaining points for money (see p. 26), reflecting parting gifts. Familiars Wizards, telepaths, and so on are often supernaturally linked to special Allies known as familiars. These are usually animals or spirits. Work out a familiar’s basic abilities with the GM, starting with the racial template of an ordinary creature of its kind. If its racial IQ is 5 or less, raise it to at least 6. Consider buying off Cannot Speak, if applicable. Most familiars have supernatural advantages: Extra Lives for a cat (it has nine lives, after all!), Mindlink and Telesend for a familiar that can transmit its thoughts, etc. Once you have determined the familiar’s abilities, work out its point total and its base value as an Ally. Select frequency of appearance as usual. This may be how often your familiar is available (on a failed appearance roll, it is sleeping, reporting to a demon lord, etc.) or how often its powers work (on a failure, it is no more capable than an ordinary member of its species, and cannot use or grant special powers) – your choice. This kind of Ally usually has one or more special modifiers. Minion, Summonable, and Sympathy are common. Unwilling is typical of demonic or otherwise evil familiars. Take Special Abilities only if your familiar grants you powers; e.g., extra Fatigue Points with which to fuel spells or exotic or supernatural advantages that emulate the familiar’s own abilities no access to these abilities on a failed appearance roll; if your familiar is stunned, unconscious, or dead; or in areas where your special link does not function (GM’s decision). Buy these abilities with a -40% Accessibility limitation: “Granted by familiar.” You can apply the following enhancements and limitations after calculating group cost (if applicable) and multiplying for frequency of appearance: Special Enhancements Minion: Your Ally continues to serve you regardless of how well you treat him. This might be due to programming, fear, awe, or lack of selfawareness. Examples include robots, zombies, and magical slaves. You are free of the usual obligation to treat your Ally well. Mistreatment might result in an inconvenient breakdown not leave. See Puppet (p. 78) for additional options. +0% if the Minion has IQ 0 or Slave Mentality (p. 154), as the benefits of total loyalty are offset by the need for close supervision; +50% otherwise. Special Abilities: Your Ally wields power out of proportion to his point value. Perhaps he has extensive political clout or access to equipment from a TL higher than your own; perhaps he grants you exotic powers. Don’t apply this enhancement simply because your Ally has exotic abilities. If his powers are very uncommon, you will already be paying extra: your Ally requires an Unusual Background, which raises his point total and his value as an Ally. +50%. Summonable: You conjure your Ally instead of rolling to see whether he appears at the start of an adventure. To do so, take a Concentrate maneuver and roll against frequency of appearance. On a success, your Ally appears nearby. On a failure, you cannot attempt to summon him again for one full day. Dismissing your Ally is a free action, but you may only dismiss him if he is physically present. +100%. Special Limitations Sympathy: If you are stunned, knocked out, mind-controlled, etc., your Ally is similarly affected. The reverse is also true, so you should take special care of your Ally! -25% if the death of one party reduces the other to 0 HP; -50% if the death of one party automatically kills the other. If your wounds affect your Ally, but your Ally’s wounds don’t affect you, reduce these values to -5% and -10%. Unwilling: You have obtained your Ally through coercion (e.g., blackmail or magical binding). You do not have to treat him as well as you would a normal Ally. However, he hates you and is likely to act accordingly, reducing his overall reliability level. If you endanger such an Ally or order him to do something unpleasant, he may rebel (GM’s option) if the consequences of doing so would be less severe than those of doing your bidding. An Ally who rebels is gone, along with the points you spent on him.</desc>

				<stat>100 points/level</stat>
				<desc>Your rate of time perception is faster than that of a normal human. The first level of this advantage lets you experience time twice as fast as a normal – that is, you experience two subjective seconds for each real second that passes. Each level past the first increases this ratio by one: three times as fast at level 2, four times as fast at level 3, and so on. Each level of Altered Time Rate lets you take one additional maneuver on your turn in combat, allowing you to cast spells quickly by taking multiple Concentrate maneuvers, run very fast by taking multiple Move maneuvers, etc. Your turn doesn’t come any sooner, however! This advantage affects how fast you move when you react, but not how quickly you react in the first place. Out of combat, Altered Time Rate allows you the luxury of extensive planning, even in crisis situations, as everything seems to happen in slow motion. You may always attempt a Sense roll, or an IQ-based skill roll to make plans or recall information additional actions. Your Ally is usually agreeable to your suggestions, but he is not your puppet. He will disagree with you from time to time. In order to do anything that depends on someone else’s reactions, you must deliberately “slow down” and function at his speed. This applies both when making a Feint in combat and when making an Influence roll instance, if you choose to Feint, that is all you can do on your turn – you cannot take extra actions. (On the other hand, you could make an All-Out Attack followed by an Attack in order to beat down his defenses through sheer blinding speed!)</desc>

				<name>Alternate Identity</name>

				<stat>5 or 15 points per identity</stat>
				<desc>You have multiple, seemingly legal identities. Each time you purchase this trait, your fingerprints (or other biometrics used to verify identity in your world) are registered under another name, and you have an extra set of identity documents (birth certificate, licenses, passport, etc.) good enough to pass close inspection. These identities may also have valid credit cards and bank accounts, but you must supply the money – additional wealth is not included in the package! If an intelligence or law-enforcement agency attempts to identify you with no clue as to your name – for instance, using biometrics or photoanalysis – there is an equal chance for each of your identities to come up. The search will stop . . . unless they have reason to believe you are a ringer. If the search continues, your other identities will eventually surface, and you will be unmasked. Once a government agency determines who you really are, your Alternate Identities are lost for good. There are two types of Alternate Identity: Legal: Some spies and undercover policemen – and even supers, in settings where they are backed by the government – may have a legal Alternate Identity. This requires at least 10 points in Legal Enforcement Powers, Legal Immunity, Police Rank, Security Clearance, etc.; the GM sets the precise prerequisites. If a super has official permission to conceal his original name (e.g., to protect his family) and to hold property in his “super” name, then that is a legal Alternate Identity combined with a Secret Identity (see p. 153). 5 points. Illegal: A criminal or foreign agent may have an illegal Alternate Identity. This has the advantage of being completely unknown when you first start out, and of course it cannot be revoked by the government. On the other hand, should it ever be discovered, you will face a stiff fine, a jail sentence, or execution, depending on the time and place. 15 points.</desc>

				<desc>You have an attack that can hold your target in place. Specify how this works when you buy the advantage: entangling your victim in vines, tying him up with webs, freezing him inside a block of ice, turning the ground to quicksand beneath his feet, etc. Binding is a ranged attack with 1/2D –, Max 100, Acc 3, RoF 1, Shots N/A, and Recoil 1. You can add modifiers to change these statistics (see pp. 101-116). On a hit, your victim is grappled cannot select the Move or Change Posture maneuvers or change facing, and is at -4 to DX. The ST of this effect is equal to your Binding level, but you can layer additional attacks on a successfully bound victim. Each extra layer gives +1 to ST. To break free, the victim must win a Quick Contest of ST or Escape skill against the ST of your Binding. Each attempt takes one second. If the victim fails to break free, he loses 1 FP but may try again. Alternatively, he may try to destroy the Binding. Innate Attacks hit automatically; other attacks are at -4. External attacks on the Binding take no penalty, but risk hitting the victim on a miss (see Striking Into a Close Combat, p. 392). The Binding has DR equal to 1/3 your level (rounded down). Each point of damage reduces ST by one. At ST 0, the Binding is destroyed and the victim is freed. To simulate vines, webs, and so forth, add one or more of Area Effect special modifiers below. Special Enhancements Engulfing: Your attack pins the target. He cannot move his limbs or speak; his only options are to use purely mental abilities, to attack the Binding with an Innate Attack, or to try to break free using ST (not Escape skill). If he tries to break free and fails, he is only allowed a repeated attempt every 10 seconds – and on a 17 or 18, he becomes so entangled that he cannot escape on his own! +60%. Only Damaged By X: Only specific damage types can damage your Binding. +30% for one of burning, corrosion, crushing, or cutting; +20% for any two; +10% for any three. Sticky: Your Binding is treated as Persistent (p. 107), but only affects those who actually touch the original target of your attack. +20%. Unbreakable: Your Binding cannot be destroyed. The only way to escape is to break free. +40%. Special Limitations Environmental: Your Binding manipulates an existing condition or object in the environment, and won’t work in its absence. This is worth from -20% (victim must be touching the ground) to -40% (victim must be standing in dense vegetation), at the GM’s option. One-Shot: You cannot layer your Binding to increase its ST. -10%. Blessed 25 10 or more points You are attuned to a god, demon lord, great spirit, cosmic power, etc. This can take various forms, but in all cases, you will lose this advantage if you fail to act in accordance with your deity’s rules and values. Blessed: You sometimes receive wisdom from your deity. After communing with your god (meditating, praying, etc.) for at least one hour, you see visions or witness omens that have some bearing on future events. Work out the details with your GM; for instance, the God of Fire might require you to stare into flames for an hour, after which you hear a voice in the flames. The GM rolls secretly against your IQ to determine whether you gain any useful insight from this experience. The ritual is fatiguing, however; at the end of the hour, you lose 10 FP. As a side benefit, followers of your deity sense your special status and react to you at +1. 10 points. Very Blessed: As above, but your IQ roll to interpret visions is at +5 and the reaction bonus from your god’s followers is +2. 20 points. Heroic Feats: Your blessing gives you the ability to perform a particular heroic feat. Once per game session, you may add 1d to one of ST, DX, or HT (other traits, such as Basic Move, are at the GM’s discretion). You must specify which trait is boosted when you buy the advantage. This bonus lasts 3d seconds, after which your abilities revert to normal and you suffer any penalties amassed during the blessing boosts HP and you are reduced to -5 ¥ your normal HP but not -5 ¥ your “blessed” HP, you will die when the bonus HP wear off unless you receive some sort of healing.) 10 points. The GM may choose to allow other blessings as well.</desc>

You are unaware of the world around you while you are in this state. Once you have entered your trance, any spirit in the immediate vicinity can enter your body and use it to speak or write messages. The GM controls what the spirit does or says. The spirit answers questions put to it by others, but it is not bound to tell the truth. This is a minor form of possession: the spirit can use your body only to communicate. However, if it has the Possession ability (p. 75), it is considered to be touching you, and can attempt full possession while you are in a trance.

				<desc>You belong to a social group that encourages its members to assist one another. When you are away from home, you may call on other members of this group for food, shelter, and basic aid. The point cost depends on the extent and wealth of the group. A single friend with a house in another city is worth 1 point; a small family, 2 points; a society of merchants along an important trade route, 5 points; and a vast alliance of wealthy figures, such as “every merchant in the world,” 10 points. In the appropriate situation, members of the group should be easy to find (14 or less after 1d-1 hours of searching), but the chance of meeting one at random is small (6 or less to meet one in a small crowd in an appropriate place). Claim to Hospitality mainly saves the cost and trouble of finding lodging while “on the road” (although if you are wealthy, you might be expected to give gifts to your hosts), but there are side benefits. Members of the group are friendly to each other advice, introductions, and small loans, if asked. The level of assistance might occasionally approach that of Contacts (p. 44). If you expect anything more, though, buy Allies (p. 36) or Patrons (p. 72). This advantage cuts both ways. If you take it, you can be asked, when at home (at the GM’s whim), to provide NPCs with exactly the same sort of hospitality you claim while away. This may become an adventure hook!

				<desc>You can displace all of your ranged senses (for humans: sight, hearing, and smell) to a point outside your body. This “viewpoint” must be a specific location within 10 yards. You can modify this range with Increased Range (p. 106) or Reduced Range temporarily by spending 2 FP per minute. To initiate Clairsentience, pick the desired viewpoint (which can be inside something) and its facing, concentrate for one minute, and then make an IQ roll. If the viewpoint is out of sight, you must specify distance and direction, and the roll is at -5. On a success, you can use your ranged senses as if you were physically present at the viewpoint (this means you cannot sense the environment around your body!). Your vision ignores darkness penalties completely. You cannot see through solid objects, but if your viewpoint were inside (for example) a closed chest, you would see what was inside despite the lack of light. If you are using or subjected to range-dependent abilities (e.g., spells), calculate all ranges from your body, not your viewpoint. You can maintain Clairsentience for as long as you like. On failure by 1, your senses go to some other viewpoint of the GM’s choosing. On any greater failure, nothing happens at all. Critical failure cripples your ability for 1d hours. To return your displaced senses, move them elsewhere, or change their facing (usually only important for vision), you must concentrate for one second and make another IQ roll. However, a viewpoint inside a moving object (e.g., a car) will move with that object with no special concentration on your part. You can only have one viewpoint at a time – you cannot put hearing in one location, vision in another, etc. Special Limitations Clairaudience: Only your sense of hearing is displaced. -30%. Clairosmia: Only your sense of smell is displaced. -60%. Clairvoyance: Only your sense of sight is displaced. -10%. ESP: Your ability is part of the ESP psi power (see p. 255). -10%.

Neither feat requires a roll against Climbing skill, provided the surface is one you can cling to. Move while clinging is half your Basic Move. If you are falling and try to grab a vertical surface to break your fall, the GM must first decide whether there is anything in reach. If there is, make a DX roll to touch the surface, and then make a ST roll at -1 per 5 yards already fallen. If you succeed, you stop your fall. Otherwise, you continue to fall – but you may subtract 5 yards from the height of the fall thanks to the slowing effect of the failed Clinging attempt. Variations in gravity affect these distances; e.g., in 0.5G, the ST roll would be at -1 per 10 yards. Special Limitations Specific: You can only cling to a particular substance.

				<desc>Your mental coordination gives you, in effect, more than one mind. Each mind – or “compartment” – functions independently and at full capability. Your compartments are identical, but hypnotism, magic, psionics, and the like affect them separately (e.g., one compartment could be hypnotized without affecting any of the others). This advantage does not allow your body to perform more than one task. A normal character may select one maneuver on his turn in combat. This may be physical or mental. Each level of Compartmentalized Mind adds one extra mental maneuver to this allotment. For instance, Compartmentalized Mind 1 would let you perform one mental maneuver and one physical maneuver (e.g., Concentrate on a spell and Attack) or two mental maneuvers (e.g., Concentrate on two spells), but never more than one physical maneuver – for that, see Extra Attack (p. 53). If one compartment is under external influence, roll a Quick Contest of Will to see whether it gains control of the body. The compartment currently in control of the body rolls at +1. Battling compartments may attempt to use mental powers on each other. Treat them as completely separate minds for this purpose, each with your IQ, Will, and mental abilities (such as Mind Shield). Two variations on this advantage are available for vehicles built as characters: Controls: Each level buys one set of controls. Controls let an operator perform his own physical or mental maneuvers using your abilities (e.g., Innate Attack or Radar), as per the rules for vehicular combat (see p. 467). The operator directs all actions of an IQ 0 vehicle with this advantage. Physical limits still apply; for instance, a vehicle can make no more attacks than it has ready weapons. Resolve conflicts between operators by rolling a Quick Contest of vehicle operation skill. 25 points/level. Dedicated Controls: As Controls, but each set of controls handles a specific task; e.g., “tail gunner.” The person manning them can’t operate anything else. 10 points/level.</desc>

You must specify a corporation, criminal syndicate, military unit, police department, or similar organization, or the underworld, merchants, upper class, etc. of one particular town. Broader Contact Groups are not allowed. You may request information from a Contact Group exactly as you would an individual Contact, using the same rules for frequency of appearance, effective skill, and reliability. The difference is that a Contact Group’s effective skill reflects ability at an entire category of skills – e.g., “business skills” if your Contact Group is a corporation, or “military skills” if your Contact Group is a military unit – as opposed to one specific skill. You must define this area of knowledge when you purchase the Contact Group, and it must be appropriate to the organization. The GM rolls against the group’s effective skill when you request any information that it could reasonably provide. However, this is an abstract success roll, not a roll against a specific skill. For instance, a police Contact Group could provide ballistics comparisons, criminal profiles, legal advice, police records, and introductions to criminals. It would not specifically use Forensics, Criminology, Law, Administration, or Streetwise skills for this, but the information provided might be appropriate to any of these “police skills.” To determine the point cost of a Contact Group, select its effective skill, frequency of appearance, and reliability level just as you would for a simple Contact, then multiply the resulting cost by 5.</desc>

				<desc>You have an associate who provides you with useful information, or who does small (pick any two of “quick,” favors for you. The point value of a Contact is based on the skill he uses to assist you, the frequency with which he provides information or favors, and his reliability as a person. Effective Skill of Contact First, decide on the type of Contact you have. He might be anything from a wino in the right gutter to a head of state, depending on your background. What is important is that he has access to information, knows you, and is likely to react favorably. (Of course, offering cash or favors is never a bad idea; the GM will set the Contact’s Next, choose the useful skill your Contact provides. This skill must match the Contact’s background; e.g., Finance for a banker or Forensics for a lab technician. Since the GM rolls against this skill when you request aid from your Contact, you should select a skill that can provide the results you expect. If you want ballistics comparisons, take a Contact with Forensics, not Finance! After that, select an effective skill level. This reflects the Contact’s connections, other skills, Status, etc. It need not be his actual skill level (the GM will set this, if it matters). For instance, the president of a local steel mill might have business-related skills of 12-14, but his effective skill might be 18 because of his position in the company. This skill level determines the Contact’s base cost: Effective Skill Base Cost 12 1 point 15 2 points 18 3 points 21 4 points Add 1 point to these costs for Contacts who can obtain information using supernatural talents (ESP, magical divination, etc.). This is common for spirits, wizards, etc. Frequency of Appearance Select a frequency of appearance, as explained under Frequency of Appearance (p. 36), and apply its multiplier to the base cost of the Contact. When you wish to reach your Contact, the GM rolls against his frequency of appearance. On a failure, the Contact is busy or cannot be located that day. On a 17 or 18, the Contact cannot be reached for the entire adventure! On a success, the GM will roll against the Contact’s effective skill once per piece of information or minor favor you request. No Contact may be reached more than once per day, even if several PCs share the same Contact. If you have several questions to ask, you should have them all in mind when you first reach your Contact. The Contact answers the first question at his full effective skill. Each subsequent question is at a cumulative -2. Don’t overuse your Contacts! A Contact can never supply information outside his area of knowledge. Use common sense. Likewise, the GM must not allow a Contact to give information that short-circuits an important part of the adventure. You must explain how you normally get in touch with your Contact. Regardless of frequency of appearance, you cannot reach your Contact if those channels are closed. Reliability Contacts are not guaranteed to be truthful. Reliability multiplies the Contact’s point cost as follows: Completely Reliable: Even on a critical failure on his effective skill roll, the Contact’s worst response will be “I don’t know.” On an ordinary failure, he can find information in 1d days. ¥3. Usually Reliable: On a critical failure, the Contact lies. On any other failure, he doesn’t know now, “. . . but check back in (1d) days.” Roll again at that time; a failure then means he can’t find out at all. ¥2. Somewhat Reliable: On a failure, the Contact doesn’t know and can’t find out. On a critical failure, he lies – and on a natural 18, he lets the opposition or authorities (as appropriate) know who is asking questions. ¥1. Unreliable: Reduce effective skill by 2. On any failure, he lies; on a critical failure, he notifies the enemy. ¥1/2 point). Money Talks Bribery, whether cash or favors, motivates a Contact and increases his reliability level. Once reliability reaches “usually reliable,” further levels of increase go to effective skill; bribery cannot make anyone completely reliable! A cash bribe should be about equivalent to one day’s income for a one month’s for +3, and one year’s for +4. Favors should be of equivalent worth, and should always be something that you actually play out in the game. The bribe must also be appropriate to the Contact. A diplomat would be insulted by a cash bribe, but might welcome an introduction into the right social circle. A criminal might ask for cash but settle for favors that could get you in trouble. A police detective or wealthy executive might simply want you to “owe him one” for later . . . which could set off a whole new adventure, somewhere down the road. Contacts in Play You may add new Contacts in play, provided you can come up with a good in-game justification. The GM might even turn an existing NPC into a Contact for one or more PCs – possibly in lieu of character points for the adventure in which the PCs developed the NPC as a Contact. For instance, the reward for an adventure in which the party helped solve a bank robbery might be a knowledgeable, reliable police Contact. Examples of Contacts The list of all possible Contacts – and their skills – would fill an entire book. Here are just a few examples: Business. Business owners, executives, secretaries, and even the mailroom flunky can supply information on business dealings. They generally provide a business skill, such as Accounting, Administration, or Finance. A mail boy or typist might have effective skill 12; the president’s secretary has skill 15; a senior executive or accountant has skill 18; and the CEO, president, or chairman of the board has skill 21. Military. This could be anyone from an enlisted grunt to a general. Such Contacts might provide information on troop movements, details on secret weapons or tactics, or top-level strategy. This could take the form of SavoirFaire (Military), Strategy, or Tactics skill – or perhaps a technical skill, such as Engineer. A Rank 0 soldier would have effective skill 12, a Rank 12 NCO would have skill 15, a Rank 35 officer would have skill 18, and a Rank 6 or higher officer would have skill 21. Police. Anyone connected with law enforcement and criminal investigations: beat cops, corporate security, government agents, forensics specialists, coroners, etc. Typical skills are Criminology, Forensics, Intelligence Analysis, and Law. Beat cops and regular private security officers have effective skill 12; detectives, federal agents, and records clerks are skill 15; administrators Special Agents in Charge, etc.) are skill 18; and senior officers (sheriffs, chiefs of police, District Superintendents, Security Chiefs, etc.) are skill 21. Street. Thugs, fences, gang members, mobsters, and the like can provide information on illicit activities, local criminal gossip, upcoming crimes, etc. Most provide Streetwise skill. “Unconnected” crooks (those who are not part of the local criminal organization) have effective skill 12; lieutenants and other powerful criminals are skill 18; and an actual crime lord (e.g., the Don, clan chief, or Master of the Thieves’ Guild) has skill 21.</desc>

				<desc>Your body itself has a Damage Resistance score. Subtract this from the damage done by any physical or energy attack after the DR of artificial armor (you can normally wear armor over natural DR) but before multiplying the injury for damage type. By default, natural DR does not protect your eyes (or windows, if you are a vehicle) or help against purely mental attacks, such as telepathy. Normal humans cannot purchase DR at all. Creatures with natural armor can buy DR 1 to 5. Thick skin or a pelt would be DR 1; pig hide, armadillo shell, a heavy pelt, or scales like those of a lizard would be DR 2; rhinoceros hide or a pangolin’s armor plates would be DR 3; alligator scales or elephant hide would be DR 4; and a giant tortoise would have DR 5. Robots, supers, supernatural entities, etc. can purchase any amount of DR, subject to GM approval. Many special modifiers are available to change the basic assumptions of this advantage. Special Enhancements Absorption: You can absorb damage and use it to enhance your abilities. Each point of DR stops one point of damage and turns it into one character point that you can use to improve traits (anything but skills) temporarily. You store these points in a “battery” with capacity equal to DR Once this battery is full, each point of DR will still stop one point of damage, but will not convert it into a character point. You do not have to use stored points immediately, but you cannot reallocate points once used. You lose absorbed points – unused ones first – at the rate of one Limited Defenses point per second. You lose enhanced abilities as the points drain away. FP, you can heal yourself. Restoring one HP drains 2 stored points immediately; restoring one FP drains 3 points. Such healing is permanent. Only HP or FP in excess of your usual scores drain away.) You cannot absorb damage from your own ST or attack abilities. +80% if absorbed points can only enhance one trait character) or can only heal; +100% if you can raise any trait. Force Field: Your DR takes the form of a field projected a short distance from your body. This protects your entire body – including your eyes – as well as anything you are carrying, and reduces the damage from attacks before armor DR. Effects that rely on touch (such as many magic spells) only affect you if carried by an attack that does enough damage to pierce your DR. +20%. Hardened: Each level of Hardened reduces the armor divisor of an attack by one step. These steps are, in order: “ignores DR,” 100, 10, 5, 3, 2, and 1 (no divisor). +20% per level. Reflection: Your DR “bounces back” any damage it stops at your attacker. The remaining damage affects you normally. The attacker doesn’t get an active defense against the first attack you reflect back at him, but gets his usual defenses against subsequent reflected attacks. Reflection only works vs. direct hits! It cannot reflect damage from explosions, fragments, poison gas, or anything else that affects an entire area. This enhancement is mutually exclusive with Absorption. +100%. Special Limitations Ablative: Your DR stops damage once. Each point of DR stops one point of basic damage but is destroyed in the process. Lost DR HP (including the effects of Regeneration, p. 80). Use this to represent supers who can absorb massive punishment but who lack the mass to justify a large HP score. Can’t Wear Armor: Your body is designed in such a way that you cannot or will not wear body armor or clothing. -40%. Directional: Your DR only protects against attacks from one direction. back (B), right (R), left (L), top (T), or underside (U). Humanoids may only take this limitation for front and back. Flexible: Your DR is not rigid. This leaves you vulnerable to blunt trauma Limited: Your DR applies only to certain attack forms or damage types. See Limited Defenses (box) for details. Partial: Your DR only protects a specific hit location. This is worth part (see p. 398). For instance, an animal with butting horns and a thick skull might have “Skull only,” for protects the vital organs. When you take this limitation for arms, legs, hands, or feet, the DR protects all limbs of that type. If it only protects one limb, the limitation value doubles (e.g., arms are -2 to hit, so a single arm would be -40%). If you have arms, legs, etc. with different penalties, use the least severe penalty to calculate limitation value. Semi-Ablative: When an attack strikes semi-ablative DR, every 10 points of basic damage rolled removes one point of DR, regardless of whether the attack penetrates DR. Lost DR “heals” as for Ablative (and you cannot combine the two). -20%. Tough Skin: By default, Damage Resistance is “hard”: armor plate, chitin, etc. With this limitation, your DR is merely tough skin. Any effect that requires a scratch (e.g., poison) or skin contact (e.g., electrical shock or Pressure Points skill) affects you if the attack carrying it penetrates the DR of any armor you are wearing – even if it does exactly 0 damage! Your natural DR, being living tissue, provides no protection at all against such attacks. This limitation includes all the effects of the Flexible limitation is mutually incompatible with Force Field. -40%. You may have multiple “layers” of DR with different combinations of modifiers. You must specify the order of the layers – from outermost to innermost – when you create your character. You may not change this order once set.</desc>

For a disadvantageous Destiny, see p. 131. When you choose this advantage, you may only specify its point value. The GM will secretly determine the nature of your Destiny, according to its point value and the dictates of the campaign. You might discover some clues about your Destiny via magical divination or similar techniques, but you are highly unlikely to learn its full extent until it is fulfilled. Note also that a Destiny may change as the campaign develops. Be aware that this advantage gives the GM absolute license to meddle with your life – the GM must make the Destiny work out! Working out a good Destiny and making sure it comes to pass require considerable ingenuity on the part of the GM. The GM may wish to forbid this advantage if he feels it would send the campaign off the rails. The point value of the Destiny determines its impact: Great Advantage: You are fated to achieve greatness within your lifetime. In the end, everyone will know and praise your name! Sooner or later, something will happen to bring this Destiny to fruition. Note that this does not guarantee “success.” If you choose to jump in front of an assassin’s knife during your first game session, the GM might just decide the Destiny is fulfilled . . . you died a hero! 15 points. Major Advantage: As above, but to a lesser extent. Alternatively, you might be doomed to die in a particular place or in a particular fashion: at sea, by the hand of an emperor, underground, or whatever. You can be grievously wounded – even maimed – under other circumstances, but you will not die. If you avoid the circumstances that would fulfill your Destiny, knowingly or otherwise, you might find that Fate has a few surprises. The sea might flood your home while you sleep, the general against whom you march might be the future emperor, or Mt. Vesuvius might bury you under tons of ash. 10 points. Minor Advantage: You are fated to play a small part in a larger story, but this part will reflect to your credit. In game terms, you are guaranteed one significant victory. 5 points. If you fulfill your Destiny and survive, it’s over – but you might feel its repercussions for years to come. In general, the GM should let you put the character points spent on an advantageous Destiny toward a positive Reputation. A Destiny that goes unnoticed once fulfilled is not much of a Destiny!</desc>

				<desc>You can detect a specific substance or condition, even when it is shielded from the five human senses. This requires one second of concentration, after which the GM will secretly make a Sense roll for you (see Sense Rolls, p. 358). The range modifiers from the Size and Speed/Range Table (p. 550) apply. You may buy a special Acute Sense (p. 35) to improve the roll, thereby increasing your effective range. On a success, the GM tells you the direction to the nearest significant source of the substance, and give you a clue as to the quantity present. On a failure, you sense nothing. Detect also includes the ability to analyze what you detect. This requires an IQ roll; the better the roll, the more precise the details. For instance, if you had Detect (Metal), you could tell gold from iron on a successful IQ roll, and might learn details – such as whether the gold is in the form of ore or bars, and its precise purity – on a critical success. The base cost of Detect is as follows: Rare (sorceresses, fire magic, zombies, gold, radar, radio): 5 points. Occasional (spellcasters, magic, undead, precious metal, electric fields, magnetic fields, radar and radio): 10 points. Common (humans, supernatural phenomena, supernatural beings, metal, electric and magnetic fields): 20 points. Very Common (all life, all supernatural phenomena and beings, all minerals, all energy): 30 points. Note that the ability to detect certain phenomena can often justify other advantages. For instance, Detect Absolute Direction. Special Enhancements Precise: On a successful Sense roll, you also learn the distance to whatever you detect. +100%. Signal Detection: You can detect an active transmission of some sort, such as a radio, radar, or laser; see Scanning Sense (p. 81) and Telecommunication but must be within twice the signal’s own range and (if the signal is directional) within in its path. +0%. Special Limitations Vague: You can only detect the presence or absence of the target substance. Direction and quantity are revealed only on a critical success, and you cannot analyze what you detect.

This trait is only appropriate for supernatural beings that spread their “curse” through infection, and only affects members of susceptible races (typically your original race and very similar races). The GM is the judge of which curses are spread this way and who is susceptible. When you buy Dominance, you must specify one natural attack – Claws, Innate Attack, Vampiric Bite, etc. – that delivers the infection. Anyone you damage this way must roll 3d vs. the HP of injury he received rolls under the damage amount, he becomes infected, and will change into the same kind of creature as you in 2d days, or at the GM’s discretion, without suitable supernatural intervention. The GM is free to impose additional conditions for infection; for instance, the victim might have to suffer three attacks, or share your blood, or even die before making the roll above. Once the transition is complete, the victim acquires your supernatural racial template (Vampire, Werewolf, etc.) plus Slave Mentality (p. 154). He becomes your subordinate. If he goes on to infect others, his victims will acquire the same traits and serve you as well. Dominance itself costs 20 points, but to control a new victim, you must have sufficient unspent points to buy him as an Ally (p. 36) with the enhancements “Minion” (due to his Slave Mentality) and “Special Abilities” for you). You can choose any frequency of appearance, and may improve this later on with earned points. If you lack the points to buy you victim as an Ally – even at a frequency of “6 or less” become your slave. Dominance persists until you die grows in power and you cannot (or choose not to) spend the points to keep him as an Ally, or the GM rules the curse is broken via supernatural means. If any of these things occur, your victim will lose Slave Mentality and become free-willed. You may use the points spent on your former Ally to dominate new victims.

It takes one second and a Concentrate maneuver to separate or merge. When your Dupes merge, your FP and HP are the average of all your copies’ FP and HP at that time. Your combined self remembers everything experienced by any Dupe. Dupes have no special ability to coordinate with one another. For that, buy Telesend (see Telecommunication, p. 91). If your Telesend works only with your Dupes, you may take the Racial limitation. You may combine Telesend with a Mindlink (p. 70) with your Dupes, in which case you are in constant telepathic contact – no die rolls required. If one of your Dupes dies, all the others immediately take 2d damage and are stunned. This is mental stun if you define Duplication as a mental trait, physical stun if you define it as a physical trait. The IQ or HT roll to recover is at -6. You also lose the points you spent for that Dupe. The GM may allow you to buy back a dead Dupe with unspent points. Alternatively, an Extra Life (p. 55) will let you bring back any one dead Dupe. Your point value drops by the price of the Extra Life, but this is cheaper than buying back a Dupe. Special Enhancements Duplicated Gear: Your Dupes appear with copies of Signature Gear ing. Duplicated equipment vanishes when you merge, even if it becomes separated from you. Treat your equipment’s HP, ammunition, energy supply, etc. just like your own HP and FP when you merge. +100%. No Sympathetic Injury: If one of your Dupes is killed, the others are not stunned or hurt. +20%.

You may only take this limitation if you have both Digital Mind (p. 48) and Possession (Digital) Shared Resources: Your Dupes do not share your full FP and HP; instead, you must distribute your FP and HP among them. For instance, if you had 15 HP and one Dupe, you could split your HP 7 and 8, 2 and 13, or in any other combination that totaled 15. You need not distribute FP and HP proportionally; with 15 HP and 15 FP, you could give one copy 3 FP and 9 HP and the other 12 FP and 6 HP. When your bodies re-combine, add their FP and HP instead of averaging. -40%.</desc>

You may also take a half-level of Enhanced Move, either alone or with any whole number of levels; this costs 10 points and multiplies Move by 1.5. Example 1: A super buys Enhanced Move 4 (Ground), for 80 points. He multiplies his Move by 2 ¥ 2 ¥ 2 ¥ 2 = 16. If his Basic Move were 8, he could run at 128 yards/second (262 mph). Example 2: An avian race has Enhanced Move 2.5 (Air), for 50 points. All members of the race multiply their top airspeed by 2 ¥ 2 ¥ 1.5 = 6. Your multiplied Move is your top speed. Record it in parentheses after your Enhanced Move trait; for instance, the super in the example above would write “Enhanced Move 4 choose to accept a slightly lower top speed if you want your speed to match that of a real-world or fictional creature or vehicle with a known top speed. This does not give you back any points. Enhanced Move does not affect Basic Speed, Basic Move, or Dodge. Its benefits apply only when moving along a relatively straight, smooth course (see Sprinting, p. 354). It does have some defensive value, however: those who attack you with ranged attacks must take your speed into account when calculating speed/range modifiers (see p. 550). Most forms of Enhanced Move have prerequisites. Enhanced Move or Aquatic (p. 145). Enhanced Move Move (Space) requires Flight with the Space Flight or Newtonian Space Flight enhancement, and affects movement in space – not airspeed. To move faster in air and in space, buy both Enhanced Move (Air) and Enhanced Move (Space). Special Enhancements Handling Bonus: You get a bonus to DX or vehicle operation skill (e.g., Driving) for the sole purpose of maintaining control at speeds above your Basic Move. +5% per +1, to a maximum of +5. Special Limitations Handling Penalty: You have a penalty to DX or vehicle operation skill at high speeds. -5% per -1, to a maximum of -5. Newtonian: This is a limitation for Enhanced Move (Space). Your space the total velocity change you can manage before running out of reaction mass. Once you have made velocity changes equal to your top speed, you must refuel before you can change velocity again. -50%. Road-Bound: This is a limitation for Enhanced Move (Ground).

				<desc>You can receive and process information dramatically faster than the human norm. This improves your mental speed – notably your reaction time – but not how fast you physically move once you react. This has several game benefits. First, Enhanced Time Sense (ETS) includes Combat Reflexes (p. 43), and provides all the benefits of that advantage. You cannot buy Combat Reflexes if you have ETS; the two advantages are not cumulative. In combat, you automatically act before those without ETS, regardless of Basic Speed. If more than one combatant has ETS, they act in order of Basic Speed, and they all get to act before those who lack ETS. You can perceive things that happen too fast for most people to discern. For example, you cannot be fooled by a projected image, because you can see the individual frames of the film. If secret information is being sent as a high-speed “burst,” you can detect it if you’re monitoring the transmission (you cannot necessarily decipher it, but you know it’s there). At the GM’s discretion, you get a Sense roll to spot objects moving so fast that they are effectively invisible; for instance, bullets in flight. ETS is extremely valuable if you possess magical or psionic defenses that work at the speed of thought. If you have ETS, your rapid thought processes always allow you to ponder a problem thoroughly and respond in the manner you think best. You never suffer skill penalties for being mentally “rushed” – although you still need the usual amount of time to complete a physical task, and suffer the usual penalties for hasty work. The GM can almost never tell you to make up your mind right now. ing half an hour to decide what to do in each turn in combat!) The exception is when something happens so fast that most people can’t perceive it at all. In that case, the GM is justified in asking you for an immediate response, since those without ETS get no response. ETS does not “slow down” the world from your viewpoint. You can still enjoy a movie by simply ignoring the frames, much as a literate person can choose whether or not to notice the individual letters in the words he’s reading. ETS also does not let you violate the laws of physics. Some things fast for you to react.</desc>

				<name>Extra Arms</name>
				<nums>31</nums>
				<stat>Variable</stat>
				<desc>In GURPS, a limb with which you can manipulate objects is an arm, regardless of where it grows or what it looks like. A normal arm can strike a blow that inflicts thrust-1 crushing damage based on ST. The human norm is two arms for 0 points. Extra arms have a base cost of 10 points apiece. Coordination You can use extra arms freely for multiple noncombat tasks. For instance, with three arms, you could perform a one-handed task (e.g., use a computer mouse) and a two-handed task (e.g., type) simultaneously. You need Enhanced Tracking (p. 53) to perform tasks that require attention to events in more than one place at a time, however. You can also use all of your arms in concert for a single combat maneuver where extra arms would be helpful; e.g., grappling in close combat. And if you have at least three arms, you can use a shield normally with one arm and still wield a two-handed weapon, just as a normal human fighter can use a shield and one-handed weapon at the same time. No matter how many arms you have, though, you do not get additional attacks (or other extra maneuvers) in combat unless you buy Extra Attacks (see below). Close Combat With Extra Arms Extra arms give a huge advantage in close combat. You cannot punch with more than one arm at a time unless you have Extra Attack, but you may grapple with all of your arms at once. Each extra arm of regular length or longer, over and above the generic set of two, gives +2 to any attempt to grapple or break free from a grapple. Having more arms than your opponent also gives +3 on any attempt to pin or resist a pin. Special Enhancements Extra-Flexible: Limbs with this enhancement are more flexible than human arms, like tentacles or an elephant’s trunk. These limbs can always reach and work with other limbs, regardless of body positioning, general layout, or “right” and “left.” +50%. Long: Your arm is longer in proportion to your body than a human arm relative to the human body. This increases your effective SM for the purpose of calculating reach with that arm (see Size Modifier and Reach, p. 402). This does affect the reach of melee weapons wielded in that hand. Each +1 to SM also adds +1 per die to swinging damage. +100% per +1 to SM. Special Limitations Foot Manipulators: Your “arm” is really an unusually dextrous leg. You cannot walk while you are manipulating objects with it (although you can sit, float, or fly). This is a Temporary Disadvantage limitation, the disadvantage being Legless (p. 141). This kind of arm is usually – but not always – Short (see below). -30%. No Physical Attack: The limb can manipulate but cannot punch or wield melee weapons, and gives no bonus in close combat. It can still wield a firearm or similar ranged weapon. Short: The arm has reach “C” (close combat only), and lacks the leverage to use any weapon that must be swung. Subtract one yard from the reach of any melee weapon wielded by that limb. If all of your arms are short, you are at -2 on any attempt to grapple. -50%. Weak: The arm has less than your full body ST for lifting, striking, and grappling. -25% if the arm has half your body ST, or -50% if it has 1/4 your body ST (round down in both cases). Weapon Mount: Instead of an arm, you have a “hardpoint” where you can mount a weapon. This may be biological, mechanical, or a hybrid of the two, depending on whether you are a living being, a machine, or a cyborg. You cannot use this mount for any purpose other than bearing a weapon. This limitation is incompatible with Feet Manipulator, No Physical Attack, Short, and Weak. -80%. Modifying Beings With One or Two Arms Beings with one or two arms can use the special modifiers above. Point cost is equal to 1/10 the percentile modifier per affected arm. Thus, enhancements become advantages and limitations become disadvantages. For instance, Short is -50%, so it is worth -5 points per arm. Someone with two short arms would have a -10point disadvantage. Those with one arm can only apply these modifiers once, but also get the instance, an elephant’s trunk would be Extra-Flexible (+50%), Long (+100%), and Weak (-50%). These modifiers total +100%, for a 10-point advantage. The -20 points for One Arm would make the net cost -10 points.</desc>

				<name>Extra Attack</name>

				<stat>25 points/attack</stat>
				<desc>You can attack more than once per turn. The “default” assumption in GURPS is that you can make one attack per turn, no matter how many limbs you have. Each Extra Attack allows one additional attack per turn. You may not have more attacks than you have limbs (arms, legs, etc.), natural weapons (Strikers, Teeth, etc.), and attack powers (Afflictions, Bindings, and Innate Attacks) with which to attack. The GM’s word on what constitutes an “attack” is final. A normal human can purchase one Extra Attack. This lets him attack with both hands at once, and represents unusually good coordination. Supers and nonhumans have no such limitation. A super-powered cop could buy two Extra Attacks, enabling him to shoot rays from his eyes, fire his pistol, and swing his nightstick all at once. A dragon might take four Extra Attacks and attack five times with any combination of his four clawed limbs, teeth, horns, tail, and fiery breath! Extra Attack is exactly that: an extra Attack maneuver on your turn in combat. It does not eliminate the -4 penalty for an “off” hand (see Ambidexterity, p. 39) or let you take multiple Aim maneuvers (see Enhanced Tracking, p. 53). You may use some of your attacks for Feint maneuvers, but you many not take multiple actions of other kinds – that requires Altered Time Rate (p. 38). Extra Attacks and All-Out Attack When an individual with Extra Attacks makes an All-Out Attack, he must select one type of bonus for all his attacks that turn. He could not, for instance, take All-Out Attack Out Attack (Strong) with another. If he chooses All-Out Attack (Double) to increase his number of attacks, he gets one additional attack. Extra Attacks and Rapid Strike You may use one of your melee attacks to make a Rapid Strike (see p. 370) on your turn, at the usual penalty. Your remaining attacks are in addition to this Rapid Strike, and receive no penalty. You may not use Rapid Strike with two or more attacks in one turn.</desc>

Each head also contains an extra brain with a complete copy of your memories, personality, and skills. These extra brains are additional mental actions – for that, take Compartmentalized Mind (p. 43). You cannot suffer more than 2 ¥ injury from any single attack to your head or neck. Any head blow that causes unconsciousness only knocks out that one head; the others continue to function! A critical head blow that would normally kill you simply destroys that head, inflicting the maximum injury noted above and crushing, severing, or exploding the head Special Limitations Extraneous: Your Extra Head grants Extra Mouth and Enhanced Tracking, but does not contain a backup brain. A single blow to an Extraneous head can do no more than HP/(1.5 ¥ number of heads) points of injury, but blows to your real head can cause stun, knockout, or death even if your other heads are unharmed. -20%.</desc>

				<desc>If you can walk on a limb but cannot use it to manipulate objects, it is a leg in GURPS (for legs that double as arms, see Extra Arms, p. 53). A normal leg can kick for thrust/crushing damage at your usual reach (1 yard for a human). The human norm is two legs, which costs 0 points. It costs points to have more than two legs: Three or four legs: If you lose a leg, you can continue to move at half Move (round down). Loss of a second leg causes you to fall. 5 points. Five or six legs: Each leg lost reduces Move by 20% until only three legs are left. At that point, your Move is 40% normal. Loss of another leg causes you to fall. 10 points. Seven or more legs: Each leg lost reduces Move by 10% until only three legs are left. At that point, your Move is 40% normal. Loss of another leg causes you to fall. 15 points. You can apply the following modifiers to all your legs: Special Enhancements Long: Your legs are longer in proportion to your body than human legs relative to the human body. This increases your effective SM for the purpose of calculating reach when kicking (see Size Modifier and Reach, p. 402) and when clambering over obstacles. +100% per +1 to SM. Special Limitations Cannot Kick: You cannot use your legs to kick for damage. -50%. Modifying Beings With Two Legs The modifiers above can be applied to creatures with only two legs. Point cost is equal to 1/10 the percentile modifier. For instance, a human with Cannot Kick (-50%) would have a -5point disadvantage.</desc>

Details are up to the GM. Make a copy of your character sheet whenever you update your backup. If you die, you revert to those statistics, losing any traits or character points acquired since then. Note that a copy exists before you die. You must tell the GM where you store it.

When you wish to “collect” on your Favor, the GM rolls against the frequency of appearance of the underlying advantage. On a failure, you couldn’t reach your “friend” in time, or he couldn’t comply, but you still have your Favor coming. You may try again on a later adventure. On a success, you get what you want (subject to the limits of the advantage). But this discharges the obligation: remove the Favor from your character sheet and reduce your point total appropriately. However, if the roll is a 3 or 4, your “friend” still feels indebted to you, and you retain the Favor . . . at least until next time. You may buy a Favor in play, just like any trait of this kind.

				<stat>40 points</stat>
				<desc>You can fly. The “default” is fullfledged, self-powered flight without wings or gliding surfaces. This works at any altitude where there is still significant atmosphere – but in the upper atmosphere, you’ll need a way to survive in very thin, cold air (e.g., Doesn’t Breathe and Temperature Tolerance). You cannot fly in a trace atmosphere or vacuum. Your flight Move is Basic Speed ¥ 2 Move in Other Environments (p. 18), you can adjust this for ±2 points per take Enhanced Move (Air). If you do not have any of the Controlled Gliding, Gliding, Lighter Than Air, Small Wings, Space Flight Only, or Winged Flight limitations, you can also “fly” at half-speed underwater. Flight includes the ability to hover at Move 0 as well. Flight does not confer the ability to do complex acrobatics and tight turns; for that, buy Aerobatics skill endurance. You can alter most of the above assumptions through special modifiers. Special Enhancements Newtonian Space Flight: As Space Flight (below), except that your space Move – or your space top speed, if you have Enhanced Move (Space) – is actually your “delta-v”: the total velocity change you can manage in space before running out of reaction mass. For instance, you could accelerate up to your delta-v and stay there (like a missile), or to half your delta-v and then decelerate to a stop at the end of your trip (like a conventional spacecraft). Once you have made velocity changes equal to your delta-v, you must refuel before you can change your velocity in space again. +25%. Space Flight: You can fly in space or a vacuum (such as on the moon). Your space Move is Basic Speed ¥ 2. If you want to be able to accelerate constantly to reach a higher top speed, like a rocket, buy Enhanced Move (Space) decelerate each turn by an amount equal to your space Move, up to your enhanced top speed. For a “realistic” space move that lets you accelerate indefinitely in a vacuum (up to the speed of light), you’ll want Enhanced Move 25-27 (Space). This is incompatible with all other special modifiers except Space Flight Only. +50%. Special Limitations Cannot Hover: You must always move at least 1/4 your top airspeed patible with Controlled Gliding and Gliding. -15%. Controlled Gliding: Like Gliding gain altitude by riding updrafts or yard per second. You can locate thermals, if any are present, on a successful IQ or Meteorology roll (one attempt per minute). -45%. Gliding: You cannot gain altitude. With a running leap, you can launch yourself with an air Move equal to Basic Move. Each turn, you can change velocity by up to 10 yards/second ¥ local gravity in Gs (Earth’s gravity is 1G). To accelerate, you must descend by 1 yard for each 1 yard/second added to velocity; top speed is Basic Move ¥ 4 (but you can go faster if towed). To decelerate, you must fly level. If you do not descend at least 1 yard, you automatically decelerate by 1 yard/second that turn. When working out turning radius, your basic air Move is 10 ¥ local gravity in Gs. Each level of Enhanced Move (Air) either doubles top speed or halves deceleration in level flight (e.g., one level means you only lose 0.5 yard/second in level flight); specify which when you buy it. -50%. Lighter Than Air: You fly by becoming lighter than air (or gaseous). A wind moves you 1 yard/second, in the direction it is blowing, per 5 mph of wind speed. If the wind happens to be blowing in the direction you wish to travel, this adds to your Move; otherwise, your Move goes down as you fight against the breeze. -10%. Low Ceiling: You cannot fly very high. This does not limit speed in any way, but the GM may require Aerobatics rolls to dodge obstacles near the ground. A 30-foot ceiling is 5-foot ceiling is -25%. Small Wings: As Winged (below), except that your wingspan is no more than half your height. You use your wings to steer and to stabilize your flight – not to lift. If your wings are crippled in flight, roll against Aerobatics skill (or default) to land safely. -10%. Space Flight Only: You can only take this in conjunction with Space Flight or Newtonian Space Flight. You can fly only in space; you have air Move 0 in atmosphere. You require a boost to reach space from any planet with an atmosphere, and are incapable of atmospheric reentry. -75%. Winged: You use large wings or skin flaps to fly. Wingspan is at least twice your height. In order to take off, land, or maneuver, you must have an open area with a radius equal to your wingspan in all directions. If your wings are bound, or if a wing is crippled (more than 1/3 of your wings, if you have more than two), you cannot fly. Treat wings as arms for the purpose of targeting and crippling. If you wish to strike blows or manipulate objects with your wings, you must pay for them as Strikers or Extra Arms in addition to the cost of Flight. -25%.</desc>

This “Gizmo” remains undefined until you reveal it. It does not even it cannot be damaged, lost, stolen, or found in a search. A Gizmo must be small enough to fit in an ordinary coat pocket, and must meet one of three criteria: 1. An item you own but did not specifically state you were carrying. For instance, if you own a handgun, and get ambushed while driving to church, you could pull out your pistol cle five minutes ago and found no weapons! 2. An item that you probably own, and that is in keeping with your character concept, but that is minor or ignorable enough to leave unspecified. For instance, a policeman might happen to be carrying a spare handcuff key, while a wizard might have some eye of newt. The GM has the final say, but should be lenient if the item you wish to have is consistent with your character story. 3. An inexpensive device widely available at your tech level. For instance, if you need to light the fuse on some dynamite, you could pull out a box of matches – and they would work, even if you just took an involuntary swim in the creek. Each Gizmo you can use per game session (maximum of three) costs 5 points. Note that this ability is not realistic! The GM may wish to limit it further, or forbid it, in a realistic campaign. Gadgeteers and Gizmos Those with the Gadgeteer advantage (p. 56) have more latitude. In addition to the usual items available, a Gadgeteer may specify that his Gizmo is one of his inventions (which must still be small). Instead of pulling an existing gadget “out of his pocket,” a Gadgeteer can use his Gizmo to let him build what he needs on the spot. He must still possess or find the appropriate materials, and know any required skills. The GM should roll secretly against the relevant skill, at -2 or worse. A failed roll means the device doesn’t work (this still “uses up” the Gizmo). A critical failure means the device backfires spectacularly!</desc>

				<desc>You can grow – really grow! As your size increases, so must your ST (or you would collapse under your own weight). Your equipment doesn’t change size! Each level of Growth lets you increase your Size Modifier by +1. Find your final height from the Size Modifier Table (p. 19). Increases in SM affect your arm and leg length when calculating reach and determining whether you can negotiate obstacles; see Size Modifier and Reach (p. 402). It takes one second to modify your SM by +1 (or by -1 as you return to normal size). If you attempt to grow in a room, vehicle, container, etc. that isn’t large enough to hold you, your growth normally stops. However, if maximum thrust damage for your current ST is greater than the wall or ceiling’s DR, you burst through it. This takes one second per point of DR. You must buy the ST necessary to support your form separately. This is 5 increases with height and is only available when you grow, you may buy it with the Size limitation (see Strength, p. 14). Use your maximum SM to determine the limitation value. At intermediate SMs, find your height as a fraction of your maximum height. This is the fraction of your extra ST available to you at that SM (round down). Example: A 6’-tall character (SM 0) has Growth 4. He can grow to SM +4, giving him a maximum height of 10 yards. He must buy ST 50 to support himself. If he has ST 15 and gains +35 ST only at full height, he may buy his SM +1, he will be 3 yards tall. This is 30% of his final height, so he will have 30% of +35 ST, or +10 ST, for ST 25. Similarly, he’ll be 5 yards tall with ST 32 at SM +2, 7 yards tall with ST 39 at SM +3, and 10 yards tall with ST 50 at SM +4. Special Modifiers Maximum Size Only: You can only assume normal or maximum size. Instead of growing at +1 SM per second, you grow to your maximum SM one second. The limitation of no intermediate SMs (restricting your use of this ability in close quarters) cancels out the enhancement of rapid growth</desc>

If this bonus makes the difference between success and failure, you collapse, apparently dead (or disabled), but come to in the usual amount of time – see Recovering from Unconsciousness (p. 423). A successful Diagnosis roll (or a Mechanic roll, for machines) reveals the truth. Example: Bruno has HT 12, 15 HP, and Hard to Kill 4. He takes 45 points of damage, which reduces him to -30 HP. He must make two HT rolls to survive: one at -15 HP, one at -30 HP. He rolls an 11 for the first one, but on the second roll, he gets a 14. This is above his HT (12), but below his modified HT (12 + 4 = 16). He passes out, and his foes leave him for dead. Roughly a day later, he’ll regain consciousness – injured, but not dead!

				<desc>You have the ability to heal others. You must be in physical contact with the subject. To activate your power, concentrate for one second and make an IQ roll. Roll at -2 if the subject is unconscious. You can use Healing in two ways: Heal Injuries: On a success, you can heal any number of HP. This costs you 1 FP per 2 HP healed (round up). Failure costs 1d FP, but you can try again; critical failure also causes the recipient 1d damage. Even 1 HP of healing will stop bleeding. By rolling at -6, you can repair a crippled but whole limb if you completely heal the HP lost to the crippling injury. For instance, to heal a hand crippled by 4 points of damage, make an IQ-6 roll and spend 2 FP. Each healer gets only one attempt per crippled limb. Healing cannot restore lost limbs or bring back the dead. Cure Disease: This requires an IQ roll at a modifier determined by the GM – from +1 for the common cold to twice the penalty, minimum 1 FP. For instance, it would cost 6 FP to cure a disease that calls for an IQ-3 roll. If used more than once per day on a given subject, apply a cumulative -3 per successful healing of the same type This penalty accumulates until a full day has passed since the most recent healing. Healing works on your own race and on all “similar” races. In a fantasy campaign, for instance, all warmblooded humanoid races (elves, dwarves, orcs, halflings, etc.) would be Special Enhancements Faith Healing: Your power works by channeling spiritual energy. This lets you cure anyone the spirits or gods deem worthy of healing, regardless of race. However, you (and possibly your subject) must behave in a manner consistent with the interests and moral codes of your supernatural allies, or this ability will not work. You may not combine Faith Healing with Own Race Only or Xenohealing. Xenohealing: You can heal beings quite dissimilar from yourself. Examples, assuming you are human: All Mammals, +20%; All Earthly Life, Anything Alive, +80%; Anything Animate (including undead, golems, etc.), +100%. Special Limitations Disease Only: You can only cure disease. -40%. Injuries Only: You can only heal injuries. -20%. Own Race Only: This is only available in campaigns with multiple sapient races. -20%. Psychic Healing: Your ability is part of the Psychic Healing psi power (see p. 256). -10%.</desc>

Hyperspectral Vision grants nearperfect night vision: you suffer no vision or combat penalties if there is any light at all. In total darkness, it functions exactly like Infravision. This trait also gives +3 on all Vision rolls; on all rolls to spot hidden clues or objects with Forensics, Observation, or Search skill; and on all Tracking rolls. If you possess Hyperspectral Vision, you cannot also have Infravision or Ultravision. This trait is essentially a higher level of both those advantages. Its game effects replace the specific effects of those traits. As described, this trait emulates realistic TL7+ sensors. The GM may permit supers to take the two special enhancements below. Neither is appropriate for real-world sensors! Special Enhancements Extended Low-Band: You perceive radiation below the infrared, allowing you to “see” microwave, radar, and radio sources.

Furthermore, whenever the GM requires a roll against a skill such as Current Affairs, Hidden Lore, or Intelligence Analysis to tell whether a certain strange occurrence is truly a coincidence or the result of a conspiracy, you may roll against the higher of your IQ and the specific skill in question. Finally, you can perceive and communicate with supernatural beings who are tied to Illuminated conspiracies in your game world cial ability to control them, but they recognize you and treat you with a certain respect: +3 on reaction rolls. The only drawback is that other Illuminati and spiritual beings are able to perceive your Illuminated nature, and there’s nothing you can do about it except stay out of sight.

Roll at -4 to distinguish objects of similar size and shape. The GM may also require a Vision-4 roll to read by reflected heat.

				<desc>You have fewer physiological weaknesses than ordinary living beings. The cost of this advantage depends on the precise frailties eliminated. Note that some forms of Injury Tolerance include others, and that Diffuse, Homogenous, and Unliving are mutually incompatible. Diffuse: Your body is fluid or particulate, composed of a swarm of smaller entities, or perhaps made of pure energy. This makes you immune to crippling injuries and reduces the damage you suffer from most physical blows; see Injury to Unliving, Homogenous, and Diffuse Targets cannot slam or grapple you! Diffuse includes all the benefits of No Blood, No Brain, and No Vitals. 100 points. Homogenous: Your body has no vulnerable internal organs, bones, muscles, or other mechanisms. As a result, you are less susceptible to piercing and impaling attacks; see Injury to Unliving, Homogenous, and Diffuse Targets (p. 380). Homogenous includes the benefits of No Brain and No Vitals. This trait is intended for entities such as iron golems, trees, and slimes. 40 points. No Blood: You do not rely upon a vital bodily fluid (like blood) for survival. You do not bleed (see Bleeding, p. 420), are unaffected by blood-borne toxins, and are immune to attacks that rely on cutting off blood to part of your body. 5 points. No Brain: Your brain – if you have one – is distributed throughout your body, or isn’t your true seat of consciousness. Your opponents cannot target it for extra damage. You may have a head, but a blow to the skull or eye is treated no differently than a blow to the face (except that an eye injury can still cripple that eye). 5 points. No Eyes: You lack eyes or other vulnerable optics, but can somehow see despite this (unless of course you suffer from Blindness, p. 124). As you have no eyes, they cannot be attacked. You are also immune to blinding attacks. 5 points. No Head: You have no head at all. This includes the benefits of No Brain. As well, you lack “skull” and “face” hit locations, and have no need for head armor. You can still see, speak, hear, smell, taste, etc. unless you take the appropriate disadvantages. Specify how you do this (supernaturally, technologically, via organs on your torso, etc.). It is common – but not mandatory – for those with No Head to have No Neck, No Eyes, or both. 7 points. No Neck: You have no neck. As a result, you have no “neck” hit location, and cannot be decapitated, choked, or strangled. 5 points. No Vitals: You have no vital organs ers can target for extra damage. Treat hits to the “vitals” or “groin” as torso hits. 5 points. Unliving: Your body is not composed of living flesh. You take reduced damage from piercing and impaling attacks, but are not quite as resilient as if you were Homogenous; see Injury to Unliving, Homogenous, and Diffuse Targets (p. 380). This trait is intended mainly for machines and corporeal undead. 20 points.</desc>

Examples include a dragon’s fiery breath, a robot’s built-in blaster, and a god’s ability to hurl lightning bolts. By default, this is a ranged attack with 1/2D 10, Max 100, Acc 3, RoF 1, Shots N/A, and Recoil 1, although you can apply modifiers to change these statistics (see pp. 101-116). An Innate Attack inflicts 1d damage per level. Its cost per level depends on the type of damage it inflicts: Burning (burn) Your attack inflicts damage using flame, an energy beam, or localized electrical burns. It may ignite fires! 5 points/level. Corrosion (cor) Your attack involves acid, disintegration, or something similar. For every 5 points of basic damage you inflict, reduce the target’s DR by 1, in addition to regular damage. (Living beings heal natural DR at the same rate as HP.) 10 points/level. Crushing (cr) Your attack inflicts damage through blunt impact, like a bludgeoning weapon or an explosive blast. It is likely to cause knockback (p. 378), and is more effective at inflicting blunt trauma (p. 379) than other types of damage. 5 points/level. Cutting (cut) Your attack inflicts lacerations, like those caused by an axe or broken glass. Multiply penetrating damage by 1.5. Cutting attacks can inflict blunt trauma and cause knockback. 7 points/level. Fatigue (fat) Your attack is nonlethal. It might involve a low-amperage electric shock or a “mind blast,” or even inflict a weakening effect such as hypothermia or starvation. It reduces FP, not HP, and cannot affect machines. 10 points/level. Impaling (imp) Your attack inflicts stab wounds, like a spear or an arrow. Double penetrating damage in flesh! Impaling attacks can target the eyes and vital organs, can inflict blunt trauma, and may slip through high-tech flexible armor. 8 points/level. Piercing Your attack involves a fast, blunt projectile, such as a bullet, or is sharp but too small to qualify as impaling, like a dart or a stinger. It may inflict blunt trauma, and can target the eyes and vital organs. There are four subclasses of piercing attack: Small Piercing (pi-): Use this for very low-energy projectiles (e.g., blowgun darts), or for attacks that tend to punch through the target and leave a small wound channel (e.g., armorpiercing bullets). Against flesh, halve damage that penetrates DR. 3 points/level. Piercing (pi): Use this for most rifle and pistol bullets. 5 points/level. Large Piercing (pi+): Use this for attacks similar to large-caliber solid bullets, or for smaller projectiles that create large wound channels (e.g., hollow-point bullets). Multiply penetrating damage in flesh by 1.5. 6 points/level. Huge Piercing (pi++): Use this for attacks that leave an even larger wound channel than large piercing. Double penetrating damage in flesh! 8 points/level. Toxic (tox) Your attack inflicts cellular damage, in the manner of disease, poison, or radiation. It cannot normally affect machines. The modifiers Cyclic points/level. Partial Dice You do not have to buy wholenumbered dice of damage. Each ±1 to damage counts as ±0.3 dice. Round the final cost up. For instance, an Innate Attack that does 1d+2 damage counts as 1.6 dice. If it were crushing points. Some attacks do only 1 point of damage. This counts as 0.25 dice. Once again, round cost up. Such attacks can still be deadly – especially if they involve the Follow-Up (p. 105) or Cyclic (p. 103) enhancement! Special Modifiers Many special modifiers for Innate Attack appear under Attack Enhancements and Limitations almost any attack – built-in guns, lasers, jets of liquid fire, gale-force winds, etc. – and to duplicate the capabilities of weapons listed in GURPS books. Fatigue and toxic attacks intended to simulate poison or disease require modifiers. Noxious agents on Claws Follow-Up (p. 105). Gases and sprays use Respiratory Agent (p. 108) or Contact Agent (p. 103), often with Area Effect (p. 102), Cone (p. 103), or Jet (p. 106). Attacks that depend on touch or on skin contact use Blood Agent (p. 102) or Contact Agent, plus one of Aura (p. 102) or Melee Attack Regardless of other modifiers, Innate Attacks are treated as ranged attacks unless given the Melee Attack limitation; then they’re considered melee weapons. Description After applying all relevant modifiers, name and describe the attack. You can be as general as “dragon fire” or as specific as “9mm machine pistol cybernetically implanted in right arm.” At the GM’s discretion, the description can imply additional noncombat abilities; for instance, a jet of high-pressure water could put out fires. The GM has the final say as to whether your description fits the campaign setting, and may modify the attack if necessary.</desc>

You can perceive the tangible world, and speak normally to those within it, but you cannot pick up normal objects or affect them in any way. Physical and energy attacks cannot harm you, but you’re still vulnerable to psionic and (nonmaterial) magical attacks. Likewise, your physical and energy attacks cannot affect physical opponents. Your psi abilities and magic spells can affect the physical world, but at -3 to all skill rolls. Although you can pass through solids, you must still breathe. When moving through a solid object, treat this as if you were swimming underwater for purposes of suffocation. You cannot materialize inside a solid object. Your “natural” form (physical or insubstantial) is considered a special effect. You must take this advantage if you can change between a physical and an insubstantial form. This trait can represent any number of abilities from folklore and fiction. You should work out its origins GM – perhaps you “vibrate” out of synch with reality, phase into a different dimension, or become a spirit. This determines your appearance, which may be transparent, misty . . . or completely normal (but you can’t be invisible without the Invisibility advantage). Your physical and energy attacks affect other beings using the same form of Insubstantiality, and their attacks affect you. The GM may rule that certain materials, energy barriers, magic spells, etc. are impenetrable to your particular form of Insubstantiality. Special Enhancements Affect Substantial: If you have any abilities that can affect the substantial world when you are insubstantial – including magic, psionics, or powers with the Affects Substantial enhancement (p. 102) – this advantage costs more. +100%. Can Carry Objects: Normally, you cannot carry anything while insubstantial. This enhancement lets you carry objects, including clothing and armor. They become physical if dropped. You cannot materialize these objects inside other objects or characters. No encumbrance is +10%; Light, Partial Change: You can turn part of your body substantial while other parts remain insubstantial, or vice versa. Thus, you could reach through a wall and tap someone on the shoulder. If you also have Can Carry Objects, you can materialize your hand, pick up material objects, and carry them while insubstantial. +20%, or +100% if you can turn an item you are carrying substantial without dropping it (this requires turning your hand substantial, too). Special Limitations Always On: You are always insubstantial and cannot materialize. If you have this limitation, there is no -3 to use magic or psionics. -50%.

Individuals using paranormal remote viewing (crystal balls, Clairvoyance, etc.) cannot see you if you would be invisible to their normal vision. Devices with these powers can still sense you, as can paranormal abilities that detect enemies, life, and so on nonvisually. Invisibility only works against one sort of vision.

				<desc>You can travel through time or to parallel worlds (sometimes known as time-jumper or a world-jumper. To do both, you must buy Jumper (Time) and Jumper (World) separately, at full cost. To initiate a jump, you must visualize your destination, concentrate for 10 seconds, and make an IQ roll. You may hurry the jump, but your roll will be at -1 per second of concentration omitted (-10 to jump with no preparation at all). Regardless of IQ, a roll of 14 or more always fails. On a success, you appear at your target destination. On a failure, you go nowhere. On a critical failure, you arrive at the wrong destination, which can be any time or world the GM wishes! You appear at your destination at exactly the same place you left your previous time or world – or as close as possible. When jumping through time, this means the same place at a different time. When jumping between worlds, this means the same place at the same time, but on a parallel world. If there is no corresponding “safe” location within 100 yards of your destination – for instance, if you jump while on an airplane to a destination with no plane at your location, or from a half-mile deep mine to a destination with no corresponding mine – the jump will fail and you will know why it failed. This does not prevent you from jumping into other types of danger, such as radiation, gunfire, or wild animals. If you have Danger Sense, the GM should roll before you make a hazardous jump; on a success, you get a warning. This ability always costs at least 1 FP to use, whether it succeeds or fails. Particularly “distant” times or worlds might cost more, perhaps up to 10 FP, at the GM’s discretion. If you are a machine, this ability does not cost you FP – but if you have passengers, each of them must pay the FP cost. For an example of how Jumper might work in a particular game world, see World-Jumpers (p. 544). Carrying Things You can carry up to Basic Lift when you travel, plus any Payload (see p. 74). Take the Extra Carrying Capacity enhancement (below) if you wish to carry more weight, or bring along other people. However, if multiple Jumpers of the same kind are in physical contact, when one jumps, the others can “hitch a ride” if they wish – even if the Jumper who initiates the jump does not want company. Only the person initiating the jump makes a die roll; wherever he ends up, the others do, too. If you are a world-jumper, “hitching a ride” is the only way to visit a new parallel world (save for a critical failure!). However, once you reach a world, you can memorize its “feel” by concentrating and spending character points to “learn” that world as an IQ/Easy skill. This takes one hour per point you wish to spend. Use this skill in place of IQ when you travel to that world in the future. You never have to memorize a world, but if you do not, you roll at IQ-3 to attempt to return. Time-jumpers have no similar restriction. You can improve this ability with practice, spending points to add enhancements or remove limitations. GMs who do not want the PCs jumping multiple times per adventure are free to impose mandatory limitations bought off. Special Enhancements Extra Carrying Capacity: You can carry more than your Basic Lift. If your carrying capacity is high enough, you may transport one person with you. Light encumbrance is +10%; Medium, +20%; Heavy, +30%; ExtraHeavy, +50%. New Worlds: This is only available for world-jumpers. You can deliberately aim for worlds you haven’t visited. The IQ roll is always at -3 or worse possible that the desired destination does not exist, in which case the attempt automatically fails – although the GM will not tell you why. All FP costs are doubled when using this enhancement. +50%. Omni-Jump: This is only available if you are both a world-jumper and a time-jumper! You must apply it to both Jumper advantages. This lets you move between times and timelines on a single IQ roll – for instance, from the present day in our timeline to 1066 A.D. in a parallel timeline where the Norman invasion of England failed. Tracking: You can travel to the made artifact you can hold or touch. Time-jumpers will arrive shortly after the item was created; world-jumpers will arrive at the current date on the item’s home timeline. Any such attempt is at IQ-2, and each Jumper only gets one try per artifact. +20%. Tunnel: You always create a portal Others may pass through it, even if they can’t jump. The portal lingers for 3d seconds, which can be good or bad Warp Jump: This enhancement is only available if you have the Warp advantage (p. 97). You must apply it to both Jumper and Warp. When you jump, you can simultaneously use Warp to appear anywhere at your destination. Two die rolls are necessary – one per ability – and it is possible for one to succeed while the other fails, or for both to fail. +10%.

You won’t arrive in thin air or underground, but you may show up anywhere within 10 miles of your planned destination. The better your IQ roll when you jump, the closer you will be to where you wanted to arrive, but it’s the GM’s call as to exactly where you appear. -15%. Limited Jump: You can only travel a certain distance through time, or a certain number of “removes” between parallel worlds, per jump. To go further, you must make multiple hops. The GM must set the value of this limitation for his campaign; it will be more of a handicap in some settings than in others. A suggested value is Maximum Range: You can only jump a certain total distance through time, or a certain number of matter how many hops you make. Like Limited Jump, the GM must set the value of this limitation. Naked: You can carry nothing when you jump! You always arrive naked. -30%. Stunning: You are always mentally stunned after a jump. -10%.</desc>

Only one particular authority – your own church or social class, a special court, perhaps even your ruler – can judge or punish you.

Example: a medieval bard (see below). 10 points. please provided you don’t injure the nation, church, or other power that granted you Legal Immunity in the first place. Examples: a medieval duke or an international diplomat (see below). 15 points. For an extra 5 points, you may add can send and receive mail or objects that the ordinary authorities cannot legally stop or examine. Two classes of Legal Immunity are of special interest to adventurers: Bardic Immunity: You have the right to sing what you please without fear of serious consequences. You may even sing a grossly insulting song to the king – you might get banished for it, but you can’t be whipped, imprisoned, or killed. Anyone who violates your immunity risks damage to his name and reputation. Other bards will compose and distribute vicious satires about him, giving him a bad Reputation. They might even expose a Secret, if he has one! This advantage applies to the content of your performances and nothing else. It is only available to true bards, in fantasy/medieval settings. To qualify for this advantage, you must spend at least 1 point apiece on the Performance, Poetry, and Singing skills. 10 points. Diplomatic Immunity: You are an international diplomat. You may ignore the laws of all countries except your own. While abroad, you cannot be prosecuted for any crime, no matter how grave; the local police may arrest you, but they cannot press charges. The only recourse for a foreign government is to declare you persona non grata. This means you must leave the country at once, ending your current assignment – and possibly your career. Foreign powers may request your extradition for normal prosecution, but your government is unlikely to comply. This trait always comes with a Duty (p. 133) to a government agency, and often has some level of Administrative Rank (p. 30) as a prerequisite. 20 points.</desc>

				<desc>You were born lucky! There are three progressively more “cinematic” levels of Luck: Luck: Once per hour of play, you may reroll a single bad die roll twice and take the best of the three rolls! You must declare that you are using your Luck immediately after you roll the dice. Once you or anyone else has made another die roll, it is too late to use Luck. If the GM is rolling in secret you may tell him you are using your Luck ahead of time, and he must roll three times and give you the best result. 15 points. Extraordinary Luck: As above, but usable every 30 minutes. 30 points. Ridiculous Luck: As above, but usable every 10 minutes! 60 points. Your Luck only applies to your own success, damage, or reaction rolls, or on outside events that affect you or your whole party, or when you are being attacked (in which case you may make the attacker roll three times and take the worst roll!). You cannot share Luck. If Strong Sam is trying to kick open a door, Lucky Lou can’t stand behind him and transfer his Luck. He’ll have to kick that door himself. Once you use Luck, you must wait an hour of real time (30 minutes for Extraordinary Luck, 10 minutes for Ridiculous Luck) before using it again. You cannot use Luck at 11:58 and then again at 12:01. And you cannot save up Luck. You cannot play for hours without using Luck and then use it several times in a row! Special Limitations Active: Your Luck is a conscious supernatural power. You must declare that you are using it before you roll the dice. It cannot be used “after the fact” to reroll a bad result. -40%. Aspected: Your Luck applies only to one specific class of related tasks, such as athletics, social interactions, or skills you use at your job. “Combat” is a valid choice, but it only affects weapon skill rolls, active defenses, and ST or DX rolls for close combat – not DX rolls to avoid tripping, HT rolls to survive, etc. -20%. Defensive: You can only use your Luck to reroll failed active defense rolls, resistance rolls, or HT rolls to resist the effects of injury, or to make an opponent reroll a critical hit against you. -20%. Magery 25 5 points for Magery 0, +10 points/level You are magically adept. This advantage comes in levels. You must purchase Magery 0 before buying higher levels of Magery. Magery 0: This is basic “magical awareness,” a prerequisite for learning magic in most worlds. The GM makes a Sense roll (p. 358) when you first see a magic item, and again when you first touch it. On a success, you intuitively know that the item is magical. A roll of 3 or 4 also tells you whether the magic is helpful or dangerous, and about how strong it is. Those without Magery do not get this roll! 5 points. Magery 1+: Higher levels of Magery make it much easier to learn and use magic. Add your Magery to IQ when you learn spells. For instance, if you have IQ 14, Magery 3 lets you learn spells as if you had IQ 17. Add your Magery level to Perception when you roll to sense magic items, and to IQ when you learn Thaumatology skill Reduce the time required to learn new spells in play (but not the point cost) by 10% per Magery level, to a minimum of 60% of the usual time at Magery 4. For instance, with Magery 3, you would learn spells in 70% the usual time. Powerful spells require a minimum level of Magery as a prerequisite, so be sure to skim the Spell List (pp. 242253) when deciding how much Magery you need. Note that high Magery lets you produce powerful results with even the most basic spells; see Magery and Effect (p. 237). The GM sets the maximum Magery allowed to PCs. Magery 3 is about right for “classic fantasy.” 10 points/level (on top of the 5 points for Magery 0). Mages in Nonmagical Settings The use of Magery becomes tricky in nonmagical backgrounds. You still have the ability to sense magic, but until you gain experience with magic, the GM should not say, “That idol is magical,” but, “That idol looks very strange to you, very sinister. You sense there is something special about it.” If you are from a nonmagical culture, you do not start with any spells, but you can still learn magic if you find an opportunity. When you enter a magical world, those who can detect your aura recognize you as a potential magic-user. How they react depends on the setting. Magery 0 costs 5 points for all mages, but you may apply one of the limitations below to the 10 points/level for Magery 1+. Limited Magery is sometimes known as “aspected Magery.” Special Limitations Dance: You must be free to use bodily motions in order to cast spells. You are not freed from rituals requiring movement as your spell level increases (see Magic Rituals, p. 237). However, you need not speak at all to cast your spells. -40%. Dark-Aspected: You can only use your powers in darkness. Regardless of the time of day or night, any light greater than candlelight or starlight deprives you of your abilities, though your aura reveals that you are a mage. Day-Aspected: You can use your powers only when the sun is in the sky During solar eclipses, you have no powers! The effects of other astronomical events are up to the GM. When the sun is down, you have none of your magical abilities, although a look at your aura reveals that you are a mage. You are not affected by being in buildings, underground, and so on; only the sun’s position matters. You know automatically (if you are awake) when it is one minute to sunrise and one minute to sunset. -40%. Musical: You must use a musical instrument in order to cast spells. You can never cast spells silently. -50%. Night-Aspected: You can only use your powers when the sun is not in the sky – on average, from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. When the sun is up, you have none of your magical abilities, although a look at your aura reveals that you are a mage. You are not affected by being in buildings, underground, and so on; only the sun’s position matters. You know automatically (if you are awake) when it is one minute to sunrise and one minute to sunset. -40%. One College Only: Your Magery only benefits the spells of a single college and the Recover Energy spell though you were a nonmage, and can only cast them in high-mana areas. You may still count such spells as prerequisites for spells in your own college. You cannot detect magic items unless they contain at least one spell of your college, in which case you roll normally for detection on first sight and first touch. -40%. Solitary: Your magical abilities are at -3 for every sapient being within five yards of you, and -6 for anyone touching you. As partial compensation, you get a roll vs. IQ to notice any time a sapient creature enters or leaves the five-yard area around you – but this only works on a single person. If there is already someone standing next to you, you won’t notice if someone else approaches. -40%. Song: You must be able to sing in order to cast your spells. You are not freed from the ritual of speaking to cast spells as your spell level increases</desc>

				<desc>You are less likely to be affected by magic. Subtract your Magic Resistance from the skill of anyone casting a spell on you, and add it to your roll to resist any spell that offers a resistance roll. For instance, if you have Magic Resistance 3, wizards have to resist. In addition, you may roll against HT + Magic Resistance to resist the effects of magical elixirs. You cannot “turn off” this advantage to let friendly wizards cast spells on you (e.g., to heal you) or to benefit from helpful elixirs! Magic Resistance only interferes with spells cast directly on you. It provides no benefit against Missile spells (which are cast on the wizard’s hand and hurled at you), attacks by magic weapons, or informationgathering spells that aren’t cast directly on you. It also has no effect on supernatural powers other than magic; e.g., divine miracles, psionics, or the innate powers of spirits. Magic Resistance, and its precise level, can be recognized by any mage who looks at your aura, or by anyone who casts a spell on you. You cannot combine Magic Resistance with Magery. If you have even one level of Magic Resistance, you can’t cast spells at all (although you can still use magic weapons). Special Enhancements Improved: You Magic Resistance does not interfere with your own ability to cast spells. This allows you to possess both Magery and Magic Resistance. +150%.</desc>

For instance, a wizard could throw a fireball at you unhindered, but he would find it difficult to use magic to turn you to stone or read your mind. For details, see Mana Special Enhancements Area Effect: Your ability affects everything in an area centered on you. The first level of Area Effect gives you a radius of one yard.

If more than one character with Mana Enhancer could increase the mana level, apply only the highest increase; do not add the effects together. This ability does not directly confer the ability to cast spells; for that, take Magery (p. 66). However, if you can raise the mana level to “high” or better, you can cast many spells without Magery! For details, see Mana (p. 235). This ability has its drawbacks: you cannot have Magic Resistance, and mages get an IQ + Magery roll to sense that you possess this trait. In some game worlds, this combination may force you to hide from unethical wizards! The GM should keep this trait under strict control, as it is powerful and easily abused in fantasy settings. Special Enhancements Area Effect: Your ability affects everything in an area centered on you. The first level of Area Effect gives you a radius of one yard. Each level after the first doubles this radius as usual; see Area Effect (p. 102). +50%/level.

Each level of Metabolism Control gives +1 on any HT roll that would benefit from such control rolls (see Bleeding, p. 420) and rolls to recover from (not resist) disease and poison. You can also enter a deathlike trance. Anyone unfamiliar with your metabolism must win a Quick Contest of Diagnosis vs. your HT + Metabolism Control to discover that you aren’t dead. In this state, each level of Metabolism Control reduces by 10% the amount of oxygen you need to stay alive (at level 10 or higher, you don’t breathe at all), and doubles the amount of time you can safely go without food or water. You are unaware of your surroundings while in your trance, but awaken automatically if injured. You may also set a mental “alarm clock” to awaken you after a certain amount of time has passed. This ability is incompatible with the Machine meta-trait (see p. 263). Special Limitations Hibernation: You can only use the trance ability, and get no bonus to HT rolls. Furthermore, you automatically enter a trance when exposed to certain environmental conditions – great cold, drought, etc. Work this out with the GM. In such conditions, you must make a Will roll to avoid hibernation. You can induce hibernation voluntarily. To do so, roll vs. Will-4 hourly until you succeed.

Modifiers: Range penalties to the subject (see p. 550); -1 per slave already under your control; +2 if you concentrate for a full minute, or +4 if you concentrate for a full hour. If you win, your victim will obey your every command until you free him. In effect, he temporarily gains the Reprogrammable disadvantage control persists for as long as you take uninterrupted Concentrate maneuvers. Once you stop, your control lingers for one minute per point by which you won the Quick Contest. (To increase this, add Extended Duration, p. 105.) If you are incapacitated attempt to force the subject to act against his principles (e.g., commit suicide or harm a loved one), roll another Quick Contest. If your victim wins, he breaks free. Roll at the moment of truth – you can march him to the edge of a cliff, but he doesn’t roll until he’s about to leap. If you lose, you cannot attempt to control that subject again for 24 hours, and he feels a sense of mental coercion emanating from you. On a critical failure, you also lose control of anyone else under the influence of this ability! Mind Control often has limitations: Accessibility (Only on opposite sex), Sense-Based (for hypnotic voices, eyes, scents, etc.), and so on. It may also have attack modifiers, subject to the restrictions that apply to attacks with Malediction (p. 106). Finally, you may apply the Cybernetic and Cybernetic Only modifiers from Mind Reading (see below). Special Enhancements Conditioning: You can reconstruct the subject’s psyche and implant suggestions. In effect, you can add or remove any mundane mental disadvantage. Add Delusions for false memories, or Amnesia to wipe memories. Your victim must be under your control, cooperative, and conscious. Roll a second Quick Contest. You are at -1 per full -5 points of disadvantages changed, but you may substitute Brainwashing skill (p. 182) for IQ. Duration in days is equal to your margin of victory. If you win and roll a critical success, the conditioning is permanent! A conditioned subject who is no longer under your direct control imposes no penalty on the use of Mind Control on others. Note that another person with this ability can use it to undo your work. +50%. No Memory: Your victims have no memory of anything that occurred while under your control. +10%. Special Limitations Conditioning Only: You cannot use regular Mind Control – only Conditioning (above). Uncooperative victims must be restrained before you can use your ability. -50%.

To use Mind Probe, you must concentrate for one second and roll a Quick Contest of your IQ (or Interrogation skill, if higher) vs. your subject’s Will. If you win, you rip the answer from his mind. The answer is what the subject believes to be true – if he doesn’t know, he’ll tell you.

Modify the roll for range penalties to the subject (see p. 550). If you win, you can “hear” everything the subject says, subvocalizes, or actively thinks about as a voice in your head. Received thought comes at the speed of speech. If you do not understand the language, or if your subject isn’t sapient, you only pick up feelings, images, and general intent. You can maintain Mind Reading for as long as you wish without further concentration. If you switch to another person, you must stop reading your current subject and roll a Quick Contest with the new subject. To read multiple subjects at once, take Compartmentalized Mind (p. 43). If you lose, you may try again, at a cumulative -2 per repeated attempt on that subject in the past hour. Should you critically fail, you cannot read that person again for 24 hours. Mind Reading is often psionic in origin, but it is just as likely to be a magical, divine, or even technological ability. The Sense-Based limitation common. If you take Hearing-Based, you can only read the thoughts of someone whose words you can hear, but can function as a “truthreader” or (with Universal) a “universal translator.” Special Enhancements Cybernetic: You can affect entities with the Digital Mind trait (p. 48), including all ordinary computers. Your IQ roll has a penalty equal to the system’s Complexity. A nonsentient system does not resist; just roll vs. IQ Complexity to succeed. +50%. Sensory: You can also tap into your subject’s senses. This lets you experience everything he experiences. If he is tortured, knocked out, or killed, the GM may require a Will roll to avoid stunning – or perhaps even a Fright Check! +20%. Universal: You automatically understand thoughts, even those of nonsapient subjects and those with whom you do not share a language. Special Limitations Cybernetic Only: As for Cybernetic, but you can only read Digital Minds. Racial: Your ability only works on those of your own race or a very similar race (for instance, humans are similar to elves, but not to dogs or trolls).

Lowering or raising your shield is a free action, but it must take place at the start of your turn. Mind Shield does protect you while you are asleep or unconscious, unless you fell asleep or were knocked out while your shield was voluntarily lowered. Special Limitations Cybernetic: Your shield protects against computer-related attacks – e.g., the “Digital” form of Possession and the “Cybernetic” form of Mind Probe or Mind Reading – instead of magic and psi. This limitation is only available to those with Digital Mind Telepathic: Your ability is part of the Telepathy psi power (see p. 257).</desc>

				<stat>Variable</stat>
				<desc>You have a pool of character points that you can reallocate under certain conditions. You may rearrange these points to add a skill (spell, technique, etc.) or mental advantage temporarily already have it. When you do, you lose any abilities to which those points were previously assigned. This advantage comes in “slots.” A slot can hold one skill or mental advantage at a time. Each slot has a fixed base cost, plus a cost per point in the pool for that slot. Both costs depend on the type of Modular Abilities you have. Computer Brain: Your abilities are actually computer programs. The GM decides whether a program exists for a given ability. If you have Telecommunication (p. 91), you may download programs, usually from a network. How long this takes depends on the speed of data transfer in the setting – a second per character point works well. In some worlds, you must pay for such programs; $100 per character point is typical. Cost per slot: 6 points base + 4 points per point of abilities. Chip Slots: As above, but the programs come on physical chips that you must plug into a socket – usually in your skull. It takes three seconds to insert or remove a chip. Chips typically have negligible weight, but cost Cost per slot: 5 points base + 3 points per point of abilities. Super-Memorization: You gain new abilities through rapid study. This takes a second per character point. You can “forget” a memorized ability instantly. You can only memorize abilities if you have a suitable reference work (book, film, tape, etc.). The GM determines the cash cost of such works. Cost per slot: 5 points base + 3 points per point of abilities. Cosmic Power: You simply wish new abilities into being. This takes one second per ability. Unlike other Modular Abilities, you only ever have one “slot,” and can rearrange your points into as many or as few abilities as you wish, to the limit of your advantage. 10 points per point of abilities. Example: Alex buys two Chip Slots at a base cost of 5 points/slot. This costs 10 points. One slot can hold a chip with a single ability worth up to 2 points, and costs 6 points. The other can hold up to 5 points, and costs 15 points. Total cost is 31 points. This appears on Alex’s character sheet as buy, borrow, or steal the chips he uses for them. Use Preparation Required (p. 114) to increase the time needed to rearrange your points, and Limited Use (p. 112) to represent an ability that you forget immediately after using it. Special Enhancements Physical: Your ability is not limited to skills and mental advantages. or +100% for any mental or physical ability. Special Limitations Spells Only: Your ability only works with magic spells, which must usually be “memorized” from a grimoire. This is mutually exclusive with Physical. Virtual: The abilities gained only apply in virtual reality, astral space, or another limited realm. -50%.</desc>

It does not have to be psionic – it might represent a magical or high-tech way to drain psi abilities. To use Neutralize, you must touch the subject (requires an Attack maneuver) and win a Quick Contest of Will. If you succeed, you successfully neutralize all your victim’s psionic powers utes equal to your margin of victory. This has no effect on the subject’s psionic Talents. Once you have neutralized someone, you cannot affect him again until his power recovers. A critical failure with this ability cripples it for 1d hours. Special Enhancements Power Theft: When you successfully neutralize a psi, you acquire his powers! You gain all the psionic abilities you neutralized – including their enhancements and limitations – for the duration. You can’t use Neutralize again until these powers wear off.

This can be one of the five human senses or a sensory advantage such as Infravision, Radar, or one particular Detect. Examples include Obscure (Vision) for fog, Obscure Obscure affects a two-yard radius centered on you. Add the Area Effect enhancement (p. 102) to increase this radius. The affected sense is at -1 per level of Obscure to detect anything within your radius. Ten levels will block the sense completely. The boundaries of the zone are easily detected by the affected sense, however; roll at +1 per level. Special Enhancements Defensive: You are unaffected by your own Obscure ability. +50%. Extended: Each related sense Sonar as well as normal hearing, etc.) blocked beyond the first is +20%. Ranged: You produce your obscuring effect at a distant point rather than around your body. This is a ranged attack with 1/2D –, Max 100, Acc 3, RoF 1, Shots N/A, and Recoil 1. Duration is 10 seconds. You can apply other modifiers to change these statistics.

				<desc>You are sensitive to omens, and see hidden significance in such things as the way plants grow, the behavior of animals, and even changes in the weather and the sky. Once per day, you may check the omens. This normally requires at least an hour, but if the GM has something in particular he wants to communicate, he may arbitrarily put it in your path. The GM rolls twice, in secret, when you use this ability: once to determine whether you discover the omen, once to see if you interpret it correctly. Discovery: To detect an omen requires a Sense roll. On a success, you discover the omen; on a critical success, you get +5 on the subsequent interpretation roll. On a failure, you find nothing of oracular significance. On a critical failure, the GM lies – he tells you that you have found an omen, but this is, in reality, a product of your own fears or wishes. Interpretation: To interpret an omen requires an IQ roll. On a success, the omen is very general; e.g., “an enemy approaches” or “a great power, long dormant, is stirring.” On a critical success, the information is more specific: out the mage in the tower,” etc. On a failure, the omen is simply too vague to be useful. On a critical failure, you blatantly misinterpret the omen – possibly in a dangerous manner. This ability differs from Precognition (p. 77), which requires no interpretation.</desc>

				<desc>A “Patron” is an NPC – or even an entire organization – that serves as your advisor, employer, mentor, or protector. An employer must be exceptional to qualify as a Patron, though; a Patron is much more than an ordinary boss! Power The base point cost of a Patron depends on its power. Use the categories below as a guide, but note that some Patrons won’t fit neatly into any of them. The GM’s word is final. A powerful individual (usually built on at least 150% of the PC’s starting points) or a fairly powerful organization (assets of at least 1,000 times starting wealth for the world). 10 points. An extremely powerful individual points) or a powerful organization wealth). Examples: a limited manifestation of a minor god, a billionaire, or a big-city police department. 15 points. An ultra-powerful individual (built on as many points as the GM wants!) or a very powerful organization ing wealth). Examples: a super, a limited manifestation of a major god, or a big city. 20 points. An extremely powerful organization (assets of at least 1 million times starting wealth). Examples: a large corporation or a very small nation. 25 points. A national government or giant multinational organization (net worth basically incalculable), or a true god who appears personally to intervene on your behalf. 30 points. Note that the base cost to have a deity as a Patron is comparable to that for a powerful mundane Patron, but divine power requires the Special Abilities enhancement (see below), which will greatly increase the final cost of a divine Patron! Frequency of Appearance Choose a frequency of appearance, as explained under Frequency of Appearance (p. 36). If the GM determines that your Patron appears at the start of an adventure, he may design the adventure to include an assignment or aid from the Patron. He may also choose to leave out your Patron, if its appearance would make no sense or disrupt the adventure. However, if the GM determined that your Patron could have appeared, and you try to contact your Patron during the adventure (for help, advice, etc.), then the contact is likely to be successful and you may receive aid. dungeon without any means of communication, you won’t be contacting anybody.) You will not know whether your Patron is “available” on a given adventure until you attempt to request aid. As a rule, you should only be able to reach your Patron for help once per adventure. Remember that a powerful Patron could be helpful without actually intervening! A Chicago hood who can say, “I’m from Big Eddie,” or a crimefighter who can flash a Q-clearance card, may carry some extra weight in a tough spot. Party Patrons Often, several PCs – perhaps the entire party – share a Patron (they are all agents of the same government, servants of the same cult, etc.). No matter how many characters share a Patron, the cost is not shared; each character must pay full price for the Patron. On the other hand, the GM will make an appearance roll for each character at the start of each adventure – and if the Patron appears for any of them, then it is usually available for all of them. The GM should scale the quality and quantity of the aid provided in proportion to the number of successful appearance rolls. Drawbacks of Patrons If your Patron is an army, corporation, feudal lord, etc., you may owe it a Duty (p. 133). A god or similar Patron may require a stringent code of behavior in return for its aid; see SelfImposed Mental Disadvantages (p. 121). A Patron might also have powerful foes that are now your foes; this can give you an Enemy (p. 135). Such factors can cut the effective cost of a Patron significantly, and turn it from a benefit to a considerable liability! Employers and Patrons Not every employer is a Patron. If you can depend on your employer to get you out of trouble (at least sometimes), it might really be a Patron. Otherwise, it’s just a job. For example, a small police department is a 10point Patron if, as most do, it takes care of its own. But the U.S. Army, though powerful, is not a likely Patron could say, “The Colonel takes care of his men.” But you could just as easily say, “I’m on my own if I get in trouble,” and play a soldier who does not have a Patron. Examples of Patrons warriors (or young wizards) whom he sends to find magical items or slay foes. lance thieves or assassins. eling Righter of Wrongs. Patron to a private detective. (They might find him annoying at times, but he helps them out, and vice versa.) Patron to an adventurer. troubleshooter or spy. as Patron to a news reporter. occasional Patron to a freelance operative, or full-time Patron to its own agents. (The difference between this and ordinary jobs is that you can’t quit . . .) You can apply the following modifiers after multiplying for frequency of appearance. Special Enhancements Equipment: Your Patron supplies useful equipment that you can use for your own purposes, and that you would otherwise have to buy. This enhancement only applies if the equipment is yours once given. A soldier with a military Patron would not pay extra for his weapons, since when he goes off duty, he can’t take them along. An adventurer in the employ of a generous noble who hands out useful “gifts” would pay extra. +50% if the equipment is worth no more than the average starting wealth in the campaign, or +100% if it is worth more than that. Highly Accessible: You can attempt to contact your Patron at any time – even when you are locked in a dungeon, lost in the desert, etc. This is most appropriate if your Patron is a spirit, a god you can petition via prayer, etc. +50%. Special Abilities: Your Patron wields power out of proportion to its wealth or point value. +50% if your Patron has extensive social or political power (e.g., the Governor of New York or the Pope), or +100% if your Patron has magical powers in a nonmagical world, possesses equipment from a TL greater than yours, grants you special powers, or has unusual reach in time or space (e.g., a super, spirit, or god). Special Limitations Minimal Intervention: Your Patron is less useful than its power level would suggest. On a successful appearance roll, the GM makes a reaction roll for your Patron to determine whether it actually provides aid; see Requests for Aid (p. 562). On a Neutral or better reaction, you receive the aid your Patron thinks you need – which may or may not be what you want. This is the classic modifier for gods who have many other minions to aid, and frequently accompanies the Pact limitation (see p. 113). -50%. Secret: Your Patron works behind the scenes. You do not know who it is and you cannot request aid directly. You might be able to call for help in such a way that the Patron gets the message (GM’s decision), but there is no guarantee that the Patron will take action. The only evidence of this kind of Patron is minor incidents and of information, equipment, or even direct aid . . . but only when it suits the Patron, and always in an untraceable way. A Patron like this often regards its aid as an investment on which it expects some return; therefore, it might not have your best interests at heart! Only the GM knows any of these details. You know nothing other than the fact that you have a Patron. -50%. Unwilling: You obtained your Patron through coercion (e.g., blackmail). It provides aid only because there is no other choice, and it definitely does not have your best interests at heart! You will eventually make one request too many (GM’s judgment – perhaps if the appearance roll comes up 18) and lose the Patron: remove the Patron from your character sheet and lower your point value accordingly. Since a Patron is by definition more powerful than you are, taking an Unwilling Patron is risky. If the Patron can find a way to break your “hold,” it will, and may well become an Enemy!</desc>

The latter is not just for machines – a zombie might have a colony of spiders or snakes living in its body, for example. Each level of Payload lets you carry up to Basic Lift/10 lbs. inside you. Those without Injury Tolerance meta-trait (p. 263) should ask the GM’s permission before taking more than five levels of Payload. You must allocate your Payload between cargo and occupants when you buy the advantage: Cargo: 20 lbs. of cargo space is roughly equal to one cubic foot of capacity. A typical car has about 10-20 cubic feet of storage space; a semitrailer has about 2,400 cf. Occupants: A human-sized being requires about 200 lbs. of capacity. For others, take average racial weight and increase it by 1/3. An actual cabin requires 10 times that weight. Your defensive advantages (DR, Sealed, etc.) also protect your occupants. If your occupants can control you, buy Controls separately – see Compartmentalized Mind (p. 43). Treat your Payload as part of your body, not as encumbrance or carried weight, when calculating Move and using advantages with limited carrying capacity, such as Invisibility, Jumper, and Warp. Machines that can push or pull large external loads – or pick them up and carry them with arms, cranes, etc. Ordinary cars and trucks have Payload, but forklifts, tugboats, and the like should buy Lifting ST to represent their abilities.

You need Penetrating Vision (p. 74) to see where you’re going. You must still breathe which limits trips to the length of time you can hold your breath (see Holding Your Breath, p. 351). Permeation differs from Insubstantiality. You are affected by gravity, and you are limited to normal movement; if you lack Flight or another movement advantage, you must walk at your Basic Move. Furthermore, you can be affected by any attack that can reach you within a solid object.

Rare: Bone, flesh, paper, and other materials rarely encountered in large quantities or as barriers. 5 points.

				<desc>You can move your consciousness from body to body. In theory, you could live forever this way, moving from dying bodies to healthy ones. However, you cannot survive outside a living host. Should your current body die, you will die! Thus, you must keep your current host alive . . . at least until you can find a replacement. To possess a new host, you must concentrate for one second and physically touch him. Attempts to possess your own Puppet (p. 78) succeed automatically. In all other cases, roll a Quick Contest: your IQ vs. the subject’s Will. Your victim resists at +5 if he is in combat with you or otherwise wary of you, so it is best to be subtle. If you lose or tie, you are mentally stunned for 1d seconds. In addition, you may never attempt to possess that subject again – he is “immune” to you. If you win, you take over your victim’s body, completely suppressing his personality. Your previous host regains control of his body (if sentient) after 1d seconds of mental stun, and “comes to” with no memory of the possession. You gain your new host’s ST, DX, and HT (and secondary characteristics calculated from these scores), as well as his physical advantages and disadvantages. You keep your own IQ, Perception, and Will, and all of your mental traits. Your social traits may apply, depending on the laws and values of your society. Skills are a special case. Your IQ-, Perception-, and Will-based skills are unchanged. Other skills remain at the same relative skill level. For instance, if you have Acrobatics at DX+3, then you would have Acrobatics-12 in a DX 9 body and Acrobatics-14 in a DX 11 body. If you occupy a sentient host, you have sufficient access to his memories for the first few hours of the takeover to learn his name and daily routine, but not enough to learn IQ-based skills. To recall a specific fact from the host’s memories, you must roll vs. IQ, at -1 per hour since the takeover. Only one attempt is allowed for any given memory! If you occupy a host for a long time, or hop between multiple bodies, the GM is free to adjust your point value to reflect the most expensive body you regularly occupy. For more on this subject, see Chapter 9. With suitable modifiers, Possession can represent diverse abilities seen in speculative fiction. Note that the Digital, Magical, Parasitic, Spiritual, and Telepathic limitations are mutually exclusive. Special Enhancements Assimilation: When you enter a new body, you may choose to “forget” any of your current skills and use the points this frees up – and any unspent points – to learn ST-, DX-, or HT-based skills known by the host, at up to not know Acrobatics, but your host knows it at DX+3, you can pick it up at DX+2 . . . if you have enough points. Skills forgotten in order to learn new skills are gone. Skills learned from your host will move from body to body with you. +10%. Chronic: When you exit a host, you can leave a “back door” that lets you possess him again without a Quick Contest. This lets you buy your former host as a Puppet. You can only use this enhancement if you have enough unspent points to buy a Puppet at the time you leave your host. +20%. Mind Swap: Your host’s mind moves into your previous body instead of being suppressed – in effect, you Telecontrol: You remotely control your new host as if he were a puppet, leaving your original body in a trance. You may choose to return to your body at any time, and must do so if your host falls unconscious or dies do not die if your host dies. +50%. Special Limitations Digital: This limitation is only available to Digital Minds (p. 48). You take over computers, not living bodies. The target system must be connected to your current host computer via a network, and you must have complete access to it – voluntary or otherwise get computer’s hardware must be complex enough to run your computer program; in general, its Complexity must be at least half your IQ (round up). You can also take over a computer using a copy of yourself while leaving the original intact! However, unless you have the Digital version of Duplication (p. 50), any system you take over this way becomes an independent NPC that thinks it is you. This can be good or bad of Associated NPC (see p. 31). -40%. Magical: Your advantage is an innate magic talent. If the subject is protected by a spell that repels hostile magic, you must win a Quick Contest of your IQ vs. that spell before you can make a possession attempt. If your victim has Magic Resistance, it subtracts from your IQ and adds to his Will during the actual possession attempt. -10%. Mindlink Required: You can only possess someone with whom you have a Mindlink. If the link is ever jammed, out of range, etc., the possession ends. If the Mindlink has the Telecommunication limitation, Mindlink Required can represent control via an implant, telepresence, or similar technology. -40%. No Memory Access: You have no access to your host’s memories. -10%. Parasitic: You enter your host’s body physically. You must have Permeation (Flesh) (p. 75) to do this, unless your host has sufficient Payload (p. 74) to contain you – and your victim must have a higher Size Modifier than you. After entering your victim’s body, you may attempt to possess him. He resists with the higher of HT or Will. You aren’t forced out if you lose, but he is “immune” to you, so you need to find another host soon. While you are in someone else’s body, he (if he is still uncontrolled) or his friends might be able to use technological means to detect you – and possibly remove you. Attacks that penetrate or ignore your host’s DR can injure you, but his HP act as extra DR for this purpose. If you are microbial, you should purchase Injury Tolerance you. The host nourishes you, and may have to eat extra food as a result. You can choose to leave at any time, the same way you entered. You may also temporarily release your host while continuing occupation. If you do, you will have to win a new Quick Contest to regain control. -60%. Puppet Only: You may possess your own Puppets automatically, but you cannot possess anyone else. -30%. Spiritual: You must have the Spirit meta-trait (p. 263) to take this limitation. Your spirit body merges with and occupies the body of your host. It remains insubstantial during the possession, traveling inside the host but otherwise inaccessible to you and effectively mindless. It can be injured as detailed under Parasitic, but only by attacks that affect insubstantial things. A genuine exorcist can cast you out by winning a Quick Contest of his exorcism ability vs. your Will. You cannot return to a body you have been cast out of for at least 24 hours. You may choose to release your host at any time. If you are exorcised or leave voluntarily, the host recovers after 1d seconds of mental stun. -20%. Telepathic: Your ability is part of the Telepathy psi power (see p. 257). -10%.</desc>

				<desc>A deity – god, demon lord, great spirit, cosmic power, etc. – has empowered you to cast “clerical” spells. Add your Power Investiture to your IQ when you learn spells granted by the deity who bestowed this advantage. For instance, IQ 12 and Power Investiture 2 (Thor) would let you learn spells granted by the god Thor You may only learn clerical spells from a fixed list set by your deity, who may even dictate which specific spells you learn. The GM determines this list and takes on the role of your deity when you wish to learn new spells. However, because you are channeling divine will as opposed to studying magic, clerical spells do not have prerequisites. In general, the more Power Investiture you have, the “holier” you are. The maximum level of Power Investiture depends on your deity, as determined by the GM. Minor deities who have a limited ability to transfer power to their chosen, or a small range of possible spell effects, might grant only one level, while major deities might be more generous. Note that Power Investiture is a measure of your bond with your deity, while Clerical Investment (p. 43) and Religious Rank (p. 30) measure social power. These need not be related. Power Investiture might be restricted to high-ranking clerics . . . but a deity can grant power to anyone it wants (possibly to the chagrin of the church!). In some cases, you can add or increase Power Investiture in play. What this entails depends on the deity. To gain, keep, or improve Power Investiture, you nearly always have to take and adhere to one or more of the traits listed under Self-Imposed Mental Disadvantages (p. 121). If you break these vows, you will lose some or all of your powers – perhaps until you have made proper penance, perhaps permanently. In effect, Power Investiture comes with a built-in Pact limitation again. You may also need to meet certain physical requirements. Some deities only empower men, women, eunuchs, virgins . . . the GM should be creative. Should you lose a special requirement Investiture may be diminished or lost, reducing your point value accordingly. You can have both Magery and Power Investiture (unless your deity forbids this), but Magery does not improve clerical spells and Power Investiture does not aid magical spells. The clerical and magical versions of a given spell are entirely different spells, and clerical spells never count as prerequisites for magical spells. If you know both versions of a spell, they do not affect one another. Power Investiture is one possible way to handle “holy powers.” It is most appropriate in settings where priests are divinely inspired wizards. For other views of divine gifts, see Blessed (p. 40) and True Faith (p. 94).</desc>

				<nums>25</nums>
				<stat>25 points</stat>
				<desc>You receive glimpses of future events. You cannot control the content of these flashes – you just know that something interesting or important might happen, at some unspecified future date. You might learn this through visions, voices, or “sudden knowledge.” A vivid premonition of a terrible event might even require a Fright Check (p. 360)! Precognition only gives information that your “future self” could learn and that would matter to you. For instance, if you’re in New York, you are unlikely to have a premonition about a random murder in Los Angeles. But if the victim was a friend, or if the killing was important enough to make national news, you might Nothing about the future is certain, though. Even if the GM has made up his mind, he could reconsider . . . although something related to the premonition should still happen. In most settings, predicted events will occur unless you take specific action to prevent them. (But the GM is free to rule that the future is immutable in his setting!) Whenever the GM feels a premonition would be appropriate, he will secretly make an IQ roll for you – usually during an encounter with a person or object. For instance, meeting someone with an important event in his future might set off a premonition related to that event, especially if it would affect you in some way. Similarly, seeing a picture of a place could set off a vision involving that location. A deliberate attempt to use Precognition requires 10 minutes of concentration, 2 FP, and an IQ roll at future, or that of another person. To deliberately read the future of someone else, you must be able to touch him. Precognition is normally limited to a week or so. At the GM’s option, however, a critical success or a very important event might result in visions from much further in the future. Note that Precognition includes Danger Sense (p. 47) – do not take both. Special Limitations Can’t See Own Death: Your Precognition cannot detect people or events that the GM believes have a high probability of causing your death. Your ability does not include Danger Sense. -60%. ESP: Your ability is part of the ESP psi power (see p. 255). -10%. One Event: Your ability works only for a particular type of event: events involving you personally (if you scanned another, you would only see a significant event if you were involved); disasters; events related to death; events related to love, etc. This limitation is mutually exclusive with Can’t See Own Death. -40%.</desc>

				<desc>Every character has a “native pressure.” For ordinary humans, this is the pressure of Earth’s atmosphere (“1 atmosphere”). A native pressure other than 1 atmosphere is a 0-point feature, but if you can survive for a prolonged period of time at a wide range of pressures, you have an advantage. This trait comes in three levels: Pressure Support 1: You can survive at pressures between your native pressure and 10 times that. (This would enable a human to survive on most of Earth’s continental shelves.) 5 points. Pressure Support 2: You can withstand pressures between your native pressure and 100 times that. (This would enable a human to survive anywhere in Earth’s oceans, save the deepest trenches.) 10 points. Pressure Support 3: You are immune to the effects of high pressure. 15 points. Pressure Support lets your body stay at a constant internal pressure with respect to a constant and uniform external pressure. This protects against attacks that manipulate ambient pressure or crush the entire body, but provides no defense against localized or transient pressure changes. In particular, Pressure Support does not reduce or prevent damage from crushing attacks or explosions of any kind. Those with Pressure Support often have the Sealed advantage (p. 82), but this is not required.</desc>

Protected Senses cost 5 points apiece. Protected Vision resists glare and eye damage from lasers, and lets Dark Vision, Infravision, and Night Vision adjust instantly from bright light to darkness.

The first level of Area Effect extends your static to everything within one yard. Each level after the first doubles this radius as usual; see Area Effect (p. 102). Switchable: You can switch this advantage off in order to allow friendly psis to affect you or operate within your area of effect. +100%. Special Limitations Resistible: Your ability is not absolute.

To use Psychometry, you must touch the subject item or location, concentrate for one second, and make an IQ roll. This roll is at no penalty for an event that occurred the same day, ago, -2 if up to 100 days ago, -3 if up to 3 years ago, -4 if up to 30 years ago, -5 if up to 300 years ago, and so on. At the GM’s option, you might notice very strong “vibes” on an IQ-4 roll, even if you aren’t concentrating. On a success, you receive the general sense of emotions and events tied to the object or place . . . if it is linked to emotionally charged events (an uneventful history might leave no impressions at all). This is not always a good thing – a terrifying impression might require a Fright Check (p. 360)! On a critical success, you experience an actual vision. No matter how well you roll, you cannot detect magic, spirits, etc. Still, a magic item, ghostly haunt, or ritual site is likely to have an emotionally charged history, giving strong impressions.

If he has a Duty, it must be Involuntary, and its frequency must be identical to the Puppet’s own frequency of appearance as an Ally or Dependent. Each Puppet costs 5 points.

This ability comes in two forms: Racial Memory (Passive): Your talent is vague and totally passive. The GM secretly makes an IQ roll for you in any situation that your ancestors might have encountered. On a success, you get a feeling of déjà vu about the situation. It is up to you to interpret this. A critical success gives a vivid replay of ancient ancestral memories. On a failure, nothing happens. A critical failure results in a wrong impression. 15 points. Racial Memory (Active): You may use this advantage actively. If you want to know something, the GM first determines whether or not your ancestors knew the answer. Then he rolls against your IQ to see if you can gain access to the information. If your ancestors didn’t have the answer and the roll succeeds, you will know that. On a critical failure, you will believe your ancestors didn’t know, even if they really did.

Opponents with the Unfazeable advantage (p. 95) are immune to Rapier Wit. If you win, your opponent is mentally stunned (see p. 420). A critical success causes one HP of physical damage as well – your victim injures himself accidentally (drops something on his foot, chokes on his own tongue, etc.). If you lose, there is no effect.

This gives you a bonus on all HT rolls to resist incapacitation or injury from such things. The bonus from Resistant applies to all rolls to resist noxious effects within a particular category – usually some combination of disease, poison, and environmental syndromes (altitude sickness, the bends, space sickness, etc.). It also applies to rolls to resist attacks that use these effects. This includes Afflictions with one of Blood Agent, Contact Agent, FollowUp, or Respiratory Agent, and Innate Attacks that have such modifiers and inflict toxic or fatigue damage. Resistant does not protect against effects that Damage Resistance or Protected Sense either stop or provide a HT bonus to resist. This includes Afflictions and Innate Attacks that do not have any of the modifiers given above.

Example: Metabolic Hazards including all disease and poison, plus such syndromes as altitude sickness, bends, seasickness, and jet lag). 30 points. Common: A group of related items encountered as often in nature as in an attack, or some other suitably broad subset of “Very Common.” Example: Poison (all toxins, but not asphyxiants or corrosives) or Sickness dromes). 15 points. Occasional: A group of closely related items more often encountered in nature than as a deliberate attack, or a subset of a “Common” group. Examples: Disease (all bacteria, viruses, fungus infections, etc.) or Ingested Poison. 10 points. Rare: A specific item or environmental syndrome, or a subset of an Acceleration (blackouts due to extreme G-forces), Altitude Sickness, Bends (decompression sickness), Seasickness, or Space Sickness; Nanomachines. 5 points.

				<desc>You can emit energy, bounce it off objects, and analyze the returned signal to build up a “picture” of your surroundings. This lets you discern size and shape, but not color or fine detail with the normal human sense of sight, and requires no light. As a result, you may ignore darkness penalties in combat. Perception is limited to a 120° arc in front of you. Your sense is “active.” Anyone who can sense the signal you emit can detect you, out to twice your own range. Unlike other sensory advantages, however, you can turn this ability off; see Turning Advantages Off and On (p. 34). Below are several varieties of Scanning Sense. Each is a separate advantage, with its own special rules. Where these rules contradict the general ones given above, follow the special rules. Each sense also has a base range. To adjust this, take Increased Range (p. 106) or Reduced Range Radar: Your Scanning Sense uses radio waves. Base range is 2,000 yards. You can only detect large (humansized or larger), dense objects. On a Sense roll, you get a general idea of the relative size of the object, and whether it is moving, but nothing more precise. You cannot get an actual “image” with Radar, or use it to aim attacks. Radar works best on flying targets; roll at -4 to spot anyone who is not silhouetted against the sky. Radar does not work at all underwater. 20 points. Imaging Radar: Your Scanning Sense uses millimeter-wave radar. Base range is 200 yards. You can spot small objects and determine their shape, but you must make a Sense roll to distinguish fine relief (e.g., to identify a face). Imaging Radar can see through thin fabric or vegetation. You get +3 to locate objects like concealed weapons, and may ignore penalties for spotting objects hidden behind light brush. Ordinary radar detectors detect Imaging Radar at -4. Imaging Radar does not work underwater. 20 points. Ladar: Your Scanning Sense uses a laser beam. Base range is 200 yards. Ladar is very similar to Imaging Radar, but the beam is narrower and offers better resolution. This gives -4 on rolls to locate objects of interest, but +4 on rolls to identify them. Only specialized ladar detectors can detect Ladar, and at -4 even then. Ladar cannot penetrate dense smoke or solid objects. It has 10-50% range in falling rain or snow, and 1% range underwater. 20 points. Para-Radar: Your Scanning Sense uses energy unknown to 21st-century science. Treat Para-Radar as Imaging Radar, except that it functions in any environment! Ordinary radar detectors cannot detect Para-Radar, although some ultra-tech sensors might be able to do so. 40 points. Sonar: Your Scanning Sense uses ultrasonic sound waves. Base range is 2,000 yards underwater. You can spot small objects and determine their shape, but you must make a Sense roll to distinguish fine relief (e.g., to identify a face). Sonar does not function if you are deafened, and can be noise (e.g., an explosion). Individuals with Ultrahearing can detect Sonar. Sonar is much less effective in air: range is only 20 yards multiplied by air pressure in atmospheres (one atmosphere on Earth). Sonar is completely ineffective in vacuum. 20 points.

Low-Probability Intercept (LPI): This is only available for Radar and Sonar. You can switch this enhancement on and off. Turning it on makes your signal difficult to detect. This halves range, but your Scanning Sense can only be detected at 1.5 times the halved range. +10%. Multi-Mode: This is only available for Radar. You can switch between Radar and Imaging Radar.

You can “see” inside any object within range. This functions exactly as Penetrating Vision 2 Targeting: By taking an Aim maneuver, you can “lock onto” any object within range and determine its precise range and speed – just as if you had a high-tech rangefinder. This gives you +3 to hit that target with an aimed ranged attack. +20%. Special Limitations Targeting Only: As Targeting, but you can only use your sense to “lock onto” targets already spotted with another sense; you cannot use it to spot things. -40%.</desc>

Physical attacks do half damage to you in this form. Energy attacks do normal damage, except for light-based attacks, which do 50% extra damage. Magic, psi, and other purely mental abilities affect you normally. You are subject to a few major restrictions while in this form. You cannot walk through three-dimensional space; you must slide along an object. Furthermore, you cannot perform any purely physical attacks or actions, and you cannot carry ordinary items or affect them in any way. You can use magic, psi, and similar abilities, however. If you cannot switch out of Shadow Form, Shadow Form is a disadvantage worth -20 points. This will make it difficult to interact with others! You may still add enhancements, but they will work like limitations, reducing the value of the disadvantage.

			<key>Alternate Form</key>
			<value>
				<name>Alternate Form</name>
				<stat>Variable</stat>
				<desc>Like the werewolf of folklore, you can assume a specific form other than your own. This can be anything built with points: humanoid, animal, robot, etc. Create your alternate form as a racial template (p. 260); however, you can switch it “on” and “off.” This template need not be a “stock” template. For instance, if you wish to retain human intelligence in beast form, you could shift into a template that lacks the beast’s low IQ (although this increases the template cost and hence the cost of Alternate Form). The GM is the final judge of what templates are allowed as Alternate Forms. While it is turned on, your Alternate Form’s racial template replaces your native racial template. Apply its racial traits – attribute modifiers, racial advantages and disadvantages, etc. – instead of those of your native race. Personal traits (including all attribute levels, advantages, disadvantages, and skills bought over and above racial norms) remain intact, although your skill levels are affected by changes to the controlling attribute scores. If the Alternate Form’s racial template has traits that conflict with your personal traits, the traits of your Alternate Form take precedence. For instance, if you become a dolphin with No Manipulators, you will temporarily lose personal advantages that affect your hands, such as High Manual Dexterity, while you are in dolphin form – and some skills (for instance, Lockpicking) will be relatively useless, although you do remember them. If you have a single Alternate Form, it costs 15 points for a racial template worth no more than your native racial template. A more powerful form costs 15 points plus 90% of the difference in cost between your native template and that of your Alternate Form. If you have multiple forms, pay full cost for the most expensive form. The less powerful Alternate Forms cost a flat 15 points apiece. Minimum cost per form is still 15 points. Example: Consider four racial templates: a -100-point “cuddly critter,” a 0-point human, an 80-point “ravenous beast,” and a 100-point troll. A human who can turn into a cuddly critter pays 15 points, as the cuddly critter template is worth less than his native template. A cuddly critter who can turn into a human pays 15 + (0.9 ¥ 100) = 105 points, since the human racial template is worth 100 points more than his own. A human who can become a troll also pays 15 + (0.9 ¥ 100) = 105 points. A human who can assume any of the other three templates would pay full cost for his most expensive form, the troll: 105 points. The ravenous beast and cuddly critter forms would cost the minimum 15 points apiece. Total cost would be 135 points. Were-Creatures: To create the classic “were-creature,” start by purchasing any trait that applies in both forms buy an animal template as an Alternate Form. Since most beast templates are worth 0 or fewer points, this will usually cost 15 points, but powerful creatures (e.g., bears and tigers) may cost more. If the beast form is savage, the template should include such traits as Berserk, Bestial, and Bloodlust. Finally, apply limitations such as Emergencies Only (p. 112), Unconscious Only (p. 115), and Uncontrollable (p. 116) to Alternate Form, as applicable. If you can only change during the full moon, add a well. Shapeshifting Races: When creating an entire race that has Alternate Form, work out the details of Alternate Form last. Total the cost of all the race’s traits other than Alternate Form, subtract this total from the cost of the template the race transforms into, and use the difference to calculate the cost of Alternate Form for the race. Add the cost of Alternate Form to that of the race’s other abilities to determine final racial cost. Example: Forest Dwarves can turn into sapient bears. Excluding Alternate Form, the racial traits of Forest Dwarves total 25 points. The bear template is worth 125 points. The difference is 125 25 = 100 points. Thus, the cost of Alternate Form is 15 the Forest Dwarf template worth 25 + 105 = 130 points. Special Limitations Cosmetic: You can assume a second, distinct appearance with no change in abilities or racial template.</desc>

			<key>Morph</key>
			<value>
				<name>Morph</name>
				<stat>Variable</stat>
				<desc>This ability is similar to Alternate Form, but not limited to specific racial templates. You can assume any racial template, within certain limits. First, the racial template must already exist in your game world. The GM might design the template himself or take one from a GURPS worldbook, but you cannot design totally new templates for the purpose of Morph (you can adjust existing ones, though; see below). Second, you can only turn into a living being, or a formerly living being such as a vampire. To change into a machine requires a special enhancement. Finally, the template’s point value must be within a limit determined by the number of points you have in Morph. If you can assume any racial template worth no more than your native one, Morph costs 100 points. This makes many forms available – anything no more powerful than your native form. For a human, this includes cats, insects, owls, and wolves. If you can assume more powerful forms, add the difference between the maximum racial template cost and the cost of your native template to the base 100 points. For instance, a human who can take on any racial template worth up to 75 points would pay 175 points for Morph. You may improve this limit with earned character points. You can always take on the form of a being you can see or touch, provided its racial template cost does not exceed your maximum. Once you have assumed a form, you can opt to memorize it by concentrating for one minute. This allows you to shapeshift into that form at any time. You can memorize a number of forms equal to your IQ. If all your “slots” are full, you must overwrite a previously memorized form (your choice) to add the new form. As with Alternate Form, the racial template of whatever you turn into replaces your native racial template. You may not add traits to templates, but you may freely omit racial mental disadvantages (e.g., Bestial), and you may always choose to drop the racial IQ modifier from a template and use your own IQ. Such changes raise the cost of animal templates, which are cheap due to limited mental capabilities. If you intend to do this, you should spend more than the minimum 100 points on Morph. Morph includes the ability to make cosmetic changes. This lets you impersonate a specific member of any race you can turn into. You can always impersonate someone who is present must commit a memory “slot” to that form. With enough points in Morph, you can use this function to improve appearance. For instance, 115 points in Morph would let you give yourself any appearance from Horrific to Handsome. Cosmetic changes still take the usual 10 seconds. Shapeshifting Races: Members of a race with the Morph ability must subtract the point cost of Morph from racial cost when determining what forms they can assume. Example: Blue Blobs have a racial Morph ability worth 125 points – the basic ability, plus 25 points of extra capacity. This lets them assume forms worth 25 points more than their native one. With their other traits, their total racial cost is 175 points. However, for the purpose of Morph, they are considered to have a racial cost of 175 125 = 50 points. With their 25 points of additional capacity, Blue Blobs can turn into creatures worth up to 75 points. Special Enhancements Unlimited: You can become anything the GM has defined with a racial template. This lets you turn into robots, vehicles, etc. as well as living beings. Most ordinary inanimate objects – such as bricks and toasters – are worth 0 points or less. With the GM’s permission, you can become a typical example of an object like this without the need for a specific racial template. +50%. Special Limitations Cosmetic: You can only change your outward appearance. Your abilities and racial template are unaffected. Conservation, but not Retains Shape. Mass Conservation: All your forms have the same weight. If the weight of your native form falls outside the normal racial weight range for a race, you simply cannot become a member of that race. The GM should be merciless when enforcing this limitation – no 150-lb. mice or elephants! -20%. Retains Shape: You can only assume forms with the same number of limbs, body layout, posture, etc. as your native form. This would limit a human Morph to humanoids (e.g., elves and giants), a wolf Morph to horizontal quadrupeds, and a bird Morph to other birds. -20%.</desc>

By default, you cannot carry any equipment, not even clothing, when you shrink. The ability to carry objects while shrunk is an enhancement. When you shrink, find your new height from the Size Modifier Table by a factor of 10. Reduce Move, reach, damage (with unarmed attacks, Innate Attacks, or shrunken weapons), HP, and DR in proportion to height. Every full -2 to SM also reduces weight by a factor of 10; for odd-numbered levels, treat the extra -1 as an additional factor of 3 (e.g., -3 to SM reduces weight by a factor of 30). Example: A 5’10”-tall character shrink until he has SM -12, reducing his height by a factor of 100 (to about 0.7”). However, at that size he has only 1% his usual Move, reach, HP, and DR, and must divide any damage he inflicts by 100. His weight goes down by a factor of 1,000,000!

				<nums>25</nums>
				<stat>80 points</stat>
				<desc>You have the power to find almost any small item you desire in an alternate world and “snatch” it across the dimensions to you. The items you snatch do not come from your own world, but from some nameless parallel; therefore, you can never intentionally take something away from a specific other person. Note that this talent does not allow you to visit alternate worlds in person – only to steal from them. To make a snatch, you must first concentrate for 10 seconds and clearly visualize the item you want. The item must be able to fit in one hand, and cannot weigh more than 5 lbs. You should have a hand free (if your hands are tied, you roll at -3), and others can see you making “reaching” motions with that hand. Next, make an IQ roll for the snatch attempt. If you are trying for information in any form, the GM makes this roll for you (see below). Regardless of IQ, a roll of 14 or more always fails. On a success, the desired item appears in your hand – or sitting within arm’s reach, if you prefer. On a failure, you obtain nothing. On a critical failure, you snatched the wrong item! This item is not immediately dangerous unless you were trying for something dangerous. Regardless of success or failure, each snatch attempt costs 2 FP. Items Available In theory, you can get anything. In practice, some things are so hard to find that it is little use trying for them. You have a good chance of getting any item that exists, or that ever existed, in your own world – or any reasonably similar item. If the desired item is unusual, the GM may apply a penalty to the IQ roll: Item is significantly different from anything that ever appeared in your own world: -1 or more (GM’s option). You could visualize “a perfect diamond, bright green, the size of a hen’s egg, carved into the shape of a typewriter,” but you might be rolling at Item is unique or almost unique in any one world (e.g., the Hope Diamond): -3 or worse (GM’s option). You cannot clearly visualize what you want: -4 or worse (GM’s option). Even on a “success,” you might not get what you were really hoping for. You cannot get an item that works by natural laws wholly different from those in your world. For instance, if your world is nonmagical (or has no magic that you know of), you cannot snatch a magic item, because you are unable to visualize it properly; you would get a pretty but powerless mundane item. Similarly, if you are from a low-TL world, you could not get a laser pistol; you wouldn’t be able to visualize it well, and your best effort would be a broken or toy gun. (A generous GM might bend this rule on a critical success . . . and then let the poor Snatcher try to figure out how to use his amulet or laser pistol without killing himself.) Information is not available except in the form of “ordinary” textbooks, reports, etc. You can grab a history book, but you can’t ask for “The Book of What Happens Next in My Adventure.” Note that the GM makes the roll if information is requested. If the roll fails by 5 or more, the information comes from an alternate world with different history, physics, etc., and is wrong – maybe subtly, maybe not subtly at all! Repeated Attempts If your snatch attempt is unsuccessful, you can immediately try to snatch the same or a similar object again. These “repeated attempts” are made at a cumulative -1 to the IQ roll. Each repeated attempt costs 4 FP instead of the usual 2 FP. To eliminate these penalties, wait one hour between attempts. The GM should be strict about attempts to circumvent this. For instance, a “.45 pistol” is not very different from a “.357 pistol” for the purpose of this advantage. Furthermore, ignore critical successes on repeated attempts made in quick succession. If the snatch being attempted is very difficult, there is little choice but to wait an hour between attempts. Duration The objects you snatch remain until you voluntarily return them or use your Snatcher ability again. To keep objects indefinitely, take the Permanent enhancement (below). Special Enhancements Permanent: Objects you snatch don’t vanish when you use your ability again. The GM is free to forbid this enhancement, as it allows a single Snatcher to amass boundless wealth by snatching small, valuable objects. Special Limitations Less Weight: Your weight limit is lower than 5 lbs. Limit Cost Modifier 3 lbs. -5% 2 lbs. -10% 1 lb. -15% 4 oz. -25% 1 oz. -30% Specialized: You can only grab a certain type of object, or cannot touch a certain class of thing. Examples: Only metal, -5%; Only money, -10%; Only weapons, -10%; Only information, -20%; No metal, -20%; Only blue things, -25%. The GM sets the limitation value using the guidelines under Accessibility (p. 110). Stunning: You are mentally stunned after a successful snatch. Unpredictable: On a failed IQ roll, you get something, but it isn’t what you wanted. The worse the failure, the more different the item is. If you wanted a loaded pistol, failure by 1 might bring an unloaded pistol. Failure by 2 could mean a water pistol, failure by 3 a book on “How to Shoot,” and so on live hand grenade. Any critical failure is dangerous, regardless of what you were looking for! -25%.</desc>

This is the opposite of Social Stigma (p. 155); membership in a given social group cannot result in both Social Regard and Social Stigma. Social Regard costs 5 points per +1 to reaction rolls, to a maximum of +4. This is not a Reputation, despite the similarities in cost and effect. You are treated well because of what you are, not because of who you are. Think of it as “privilege by association.” The way you are treated on a good reaction roll will depend on the type of Regard: Feared: Others will react to you much as if you had successfully used Intimidation skill (p. 202). Those who like you stand aside, while those who dislike you flee rather than risk a confrontation. You are met with silent deference, and perhaps even respect, but never friendly familiarity. Examples: a god among men or an Amazon warrior. Respected: You receive polite and obsequious deference, much as if you had high Status (p. 28), regardless of your actual Status. Social interactions other than combat usually go smoothly for you – but there will be times when the kowtowing gets in the way. Examples: a member of a priest caste or a ruling race. Venerated: Total strangers react to you in a caring way. They give up seats, let you ahead of them in lines, and receive your every word as pearls of wisdom. They also take great pains to prevent you from putting yourself in danger or even discomfort – even when you need to do so! Example: an elderly person in many societies.</desc>

This effectively raises your attribute scores for the purpose of those skills only; thus, this is an inexpensive way to be adept at small class of skills. effective to raise attributes.) reaction rolls made by anyone in a position to notice your Talent, if he would be impressed by your aptitude bonus, you must demonstrate your Talent – most often by using the affected skills. to learn the affected skills in play, regardless of how you learn them. Reduce the time required by 10% per level of Talent; e.g., Animal Friend 2 would let you learn animal-related skills in 80% the usual time. This has no effect on the point cost of your skills. You may never have more than four levels of a particular Talent. However, overlapping Talents can give skill bonuses (only) in excess of +4. Cost of Talents The cost of a Talent depends on the size of the group of skills affected: Small (6 or fewer related skills): 5 points/level. Medium (7 to 12 related skills): 10 points/level. Large (13 or more related skills): 15 points/level. Skills with multiple specialties are considered to be one skill for this purpose. Once you buy a Talent, the list of affected skills is fixed. (Exception: The GM may rule that a Talent affects new skills appearing in later GURPS supplements, or skills he invents in the course of the campaign, if the Talent would logically be of value to those skills.) Examples of Talents The following Talents are considered standard, and exist in most campaigns: Animal Friend: Animal Handling, Falconry, Packing, Riding, Teamster, and Veterinary. Reaction bonus: all animals. 5 points/level. Artificer: Armoury, Carpentry, Electrician, Electronics Repair, Engineer, Machinist, Masonry, Mechanic, and Smith. Reaction bonus: anyone you do work for. 10 points/level. Business Acumen: Accounting, Administration, Economics, Finance, Gambling, Market Analysis, Merchant, and Propaganda. Reaction bonus: anyone you do business with. 10 points/level. Gifted Artist: Artist, Jeweler, Leatherworking, Photography, and Sewing. Reaction bonus: anyone buying or critiquing your work. 5 points/level. Green Thumb: Biology, Farming, Gardening, Herb Lore, and Naturalist. Reaction bonus: gardeners and sentient plants. 5 points/level. Healer: Diagnosis, Esoteric Medicine, First Aid, Pharmacy, Physician, Physiology, Psychology, Surgery, and Veterinary. Reaction bonus: patients, both past and present. 10 points/level. Mathematical Ability: Accounting, Astronomy, Cryptography, Engineer, Finance, Market Analysis, Mathematics, and Physics. Reaction bonus: engineers and scientists. 10 points/level. Musical Ability: Group Performance (Conducting), Musical Composition, Musical Influence, Musical Instrument, and Singing. Reaction bonus: anyone listening to or critiquing your work. 5 points/level. Outdoorsman: Camouflage, Fishing, Mimicry, Naturalist, Navigation, Survival, and Tracking. Reaction bonus: explorers, nature lovers, and the like. 10 points/level. Smooth Operator: Acting, Carousing, Detect Lies, Diplomacy, Fast-Talk, Intimidation, Leadership, Panhandling, Politics, Public Speaking, Savoir-Faire, Sex Appeal, and Streetwise. Reaction bonus: con artists, politicians, salesmen, etc. – but only if you are not trying to manipulate them. 15 points/level. Custom Talents At the GM’s option, you may create your own Talent with a custom skill list. However, the GM’s word is law when determining which skills are Talent is worth. Talents should always be believable inborn aptitudes.

				<desc>You can communicate over long distances without speaking aloud. You can send words at the speed of ordinary speech or pictures at the speed at which you could draw them. To establish contact requires one second of concentration and an IQ roll. After that, no concentration is required. You can maintain multiple contacts, but the IQ roll is at a cumulative -1 per contact after the first. Telecommunication works amid even the loudest noises, although interference and jamming can disrupt your signal. Those with suitable equipment may attempt to locate, intercept, or jam your transmission. This requires an Electronics Operation (Communications) roll for an electromagnetic signal, an Electronics Operation (Psychotronics) roll for a psionic signal, and so forth. Each variety of Telecommunication is a separate advantage with its own benefits and drawbacks. Some forms have limited range, which you can adjust using Increased Range Infrared Communication: You communicate using a modulated infrared beam. Base range is 500 yards in a direct line of sight. The short range and line-of-sight requirement make jamming and eavesdropping almost impossible under normal circumstances. You can only communicate with those who have this advantage or an infrared communicator. 10 points. Laser Communication: You communicate using a modulated laser beam. Base range is 50 miles in a direct line of sight. The narrow beam and line-of-sight requirement make it extremely hard to eavesdrop on you. You can only communicate with people who have this advantage or a laser communicator. 15 points. Radio: You communicate using radio waves. Base range is 10 miles. Your signal is omnidirectional, but because you can shift frequencies, eavesdroppers must still roll vs. Electronics Operation (Communications) to listen in. A side benefit of this ability is that you can receive AM, FM, CB, and other ordinary radio signals on an IQ roll (takes one second). Note that radio-frequency “noise” from lightning and unshielded electronics can interfere with Radio. Radio does not work at all underwater. 10 points. Telesend: You can transmit thoughts directly to others via magic, psi, or other exotic means (be specific!). Your subject receives your thoughts even if he lacks this ability. Range is theoretically unlimited, but the IQ roll to use this ability takes the range penalties given under LongDistance Modifiers (p. 241). If you cannot see or otherwise sense your subject, you have an additional penalty: -1 for family, lovers, or close friends; -3 for casual friends and acquaintances; or -5 for someone met only briefly. 30 points. Special Enhancements Broadcast: This enhancement is only available for Telesend. It lets you send your thoughts to everyone in a radius around you. This requires an IQ roll at the long-distance modifier for the desired radius, plus an additional -4. +50%. Short Wave: This is only available for Radio. You can bounce your signal off a planet’s ionosphere (if the planet has one). This lets you transmit to (or receive from) any point on the planet. Note that solar flares, weather, etc. can disrupt short-wave communications. Universal: Your messages are automatically translated into your subject’s language. The GM may limit this enhancement to individuals from advanced tech levels, or restrict it to Telesend. +50%. Video: You are not limited to simple pictures! You can transmit real-time video of anything you can see. +40%. Special Limitations Racial: Your ability only works on those of your own race or a very similar race, per Mind Reading (p. 69). Receive Only: You can receive but not send. This limitation is not available for Telesend. -50%. Send Only: You can send but not receive. This limitation is not available for Telesend. -50%. Telepathic: Your ability is part of the Telepathy psi power (see p. 257). Vague: You cannot send speech or pictures. You can only send a simple code (e.g., Morse code) – or general concepts and emotions, in the case of Telesend. -50%.</desc>

				<desc>You can move objects without touching them. In effect, you manifest an invisible force that acts under your conscious direction at a distant point. Specify how you do this; possibilities include magnetism, psionic psychokinesis, an ultra-tech “tractor beam,” or a supernatural “poltergeist effect.” You can manipulate distant objects just as if you were grasping them in a pair of hands with ST equal to your Telekinesis (TK) level. You can move any object you have strength enough to lift, at a Move equal to your TK level, modified as usual for encumbrance level (see Encumbrance and Move, p. 17). Regardless of level, maximum range is 10 yards. To modify range, take Increased Range (p. 106) or Reduced Range (p. 115). Telekinesis requires constant concentration to use. In combat, this means you must take a Concentrate maneuver on your turn. Your TK may then perform one standard maneuver as if were a disembodied pair of hands at some point within your range: a Ready maneuver to pick up an object; a Move maneuver to lift and carry it; an Attack maneuver to throw it, or to grab or strike directly; and so on. Example: On your turn in combat, you take a Concentrate maneuver and state that your TK is taking an Attack maneuver to grab a gun from a foe. The following turn, you can Concentrate again and specify that your TK is taking an Aim or Wait maneuver to cover your enemy with the gun, an Attack maneuver to shoot him, or a Move maneuver to bring the gun to your hand. No rolls are necessary for ordinary lifting and movement. For more complex actions, the GM might require you to make a DX or skill roll. In situations where you would roll against ST, roll against your TK level instead. All of the above assumes that you are using TK to perform a task at a distance. TK can also discreetly assist you with such skills as Gambling and Surgery. In general, anything that would benefit from High Manual Dexterity (p. 59) gets a +4 bonus if you can successfully make an IQ roll to use your TK properly. On a failure, the GM may assess any penalty he feels is appropriate. Grappling and Striking: You can use TK to attack a foe directly. Roll against DX or an unarmed combat skill to hit. Your foe defends as if attacked by an invisible opponent (see Visibility, p. 394). If you grapple, your foe cannot grab hold of the TK force, but he can try to break free as usual – and if he also has TK, he can take a Concentrate maneuver and use his TK level instead of his ST. The turn after you grapple a foe using TK, your TK can use a Move maneuver to pick him up off the ground, provided you have enough TK to lift his weight. Someone in this position can’t do anything that relies on ground contact (run, retreat, etc.), but can perform any other action that is possible while grappled. Levitation: If you have enough TK to lift your own body weight, you can levitate. Take the Concentrate maneuver and have your TK take Move maneuvers to propel your body. For true psychokinetic flight, take Flight tion (below). Throwing: By applying a TK impulse for a fraction of a second, you can throw objects faster (and farther) than you can move them. Take a Concentrate maneuver and have your TK take an Attack maneuver. This works just as if you were throwing the object with ST equal to your TK level. Roll against Throwing or Thrown Weapon skill to hit, depending on the object being hurled. For 1/2D and Max purposes, measure range from the object (not yourself!) to the target; for the purpose of range penalties, use the sum of the distance from you to the object and from the object to the target. Once you throw something, you have “released” your telekinetic grip – your TK must take a Ready maneuver to pick it up again. Special Limitations Magnetic: Your TK is “super magnetism,” and only affects ferrous metals: iron (including steel), nickel, and cobalt. -50%. Psychokinetic: Your ability is part of the Psychokinesis psi power (see p. 256). This makes it mental (2) rather than physical (3). -10%. Visible: Your TK is not an invisible force, but a disembodied hand, glowing “tractor beam,” or similar. This makes it much easier for others to defend against your TK attacks (do not use the Visibility rules). -20%.</desc>

The benefits of this trait are not cumulative with those of technological aids such as binoculars or scopes. If you have both, you must opt to use one or the other.

Each level of Temperature Tolerance adds HT degrees to your comfort zone, distributed in any way you wish between the “cold” and “hot” ends of the zone. Temperature Tolerance confers no special resistance to attacks by fire or ice unless the only damage is a result of a rise or fall in the ambient temperature. In particular, it cannot help you if your body temperature is being manipulated. In a realistic campaign, the GM should limit normal humans to Temperature Tolerance 1 or 2.

				<desc>You have been trained by – or are – a true master of the martial arts. Your exceptional talent means you have half the usual penalty to make a Rapid Strike (see Melee Attack Options, p. 370), or to parry more than once per turn (see Parrying, p. 376). These benefits apply to all your unarmed combat skills (Judo, Karate, etc.) and Melee Weapon skills. Furthermore, you can focus your inner strength (often called “chi”) to perform amazing feats! This permits you to learn Flying Leap, Invisibility Art, Power Blow, and many other skills – anything that requires this advantage as a prerequisite (see Chapter 4). The GM is free to set prerequisites for this advantage if he wishes. Common examples from fiction include Judo, Karate, Melee Weapon skills, Philosophy, and Theology. This ability is definitely “larger than life.” The GM may wish to forbid it in a realistic campaign.</desc>

				<name>True Faith</name>
				<nums>25</nums>
				<stat>15 points</stat>
				<desc>You have a profound religious faith that protects you from “evil” supernatural beings such as demons and vampires. To enjoy this protection, you must actively assert your faith by wielding a physical symbol revered by your religion (e.g., crucifix, Torah, or Koran), chanting, dancing, or whatever else is appropriate to your beliefs. If you wish to use this ability in combat – to repel zombies, for instance – then you must choose the Concentrate maneuver each turn, and can do nothing else. For as long as you assert your faith, no malign supernatural entity (GM’s judgment as to what this covers) may approach within one yard of you. If one is forced into this radius, it must leave by the most direct route possible, as if it suffered from Dread coming closer, it must make a Will roll. On a success, it may run past you to escape, pushing you aside if necessary (but using only the minimum force required to escape). On a failure, the monster is cowed. It must cower, helplessly, and cannot move, defend itself, or take any other action. To keep True Faith, you must behave in a manner consistent with your religion. You will nearly always have to take and adhere to one or more of the traits listed under Self-Imposed Mental Disadvantages (p. 121). In effect, True Faith comes with a built-in Pact limitation (p. 113); do not apply this modifier again. You do not have to be kind, loving, or law-abiding, however. A violent bigot or religious terrorist can be just as sincere in his religious devotion as a saintly ascetic.</desc>

Roll each minute vs. the highest of Engineer (Mining), Prospecting-3, and IQ-4 to dig a stable tunnel. This can be modified upward for hard rock and downward for soft rock or loose earth.

				<desc>You can see ultraviolet light (UV). Solar UV is present outdoors during the day, even under cloud cover, but is stopped by window glass or any solid barrier (earth, stone, etc.). Fluorescent lamps also emit UV. Provided UV is present, you can make out more colors than those with normal vision. This helps you discern outlines; spot trace quantities of dust, dyes, etc.; and identify minerals and plants. You get ence of UV, as well as to all Forensics, Observation, and Search rolls to spot clues or hidden objects. At night, a small amount of UV reaches the ground from the stars. This doesn’t let you see in the dark, but it does let you ignore -2 in darkness penalties (cumulative with Night Vision). UV penetrates farther underwater than visible light. This lets you halve all vision penalties underwater as anyone else). Cost depends on your capabilities: You can only see UV, and are blind indoors, underground, or anywhere else there is no UV, even when there are normal light sources present: 0 points. You can see both visible light and UV: 10 points.</desc>

You are exempt from Fright Checks, and reaction modifiers rarely affect you either way. You treat strangers with distant courtesy, no matter how strange they are, as long as they’re well-behaved. You have the normal reaction penalty toward anyone who does something rude or rowdy, but you remain civil even if forced to violence. Intimidation You are not emotionless – you just never display strong feelings. The stereotypical aged kung fu master or English butler has this trait. You must roleplay this advantage fully, or the GM can declare that it has been lost. In a campaign where Fright Checks are an hourly occurrence, the GM can charge 20 points – or more! – or disallow Unfazeable altogether. This advantage is incompatible with all Phobias.</desc>

				<stat>50 to 150 points</stat>
				<desc>You cannot be killed! You are subject to all the other effects of injury. You feel pain, your wounds slow you, and you can be stunned or knocked out. You lose the use of any limb that receives a crippling wound, and you might even lose the limb itself. You can even lose attribute levels, advantages, etc. to disease, injury, or poison. However, you will only die if your body is physically destroyed – and sometimes not even then. This advantage comes in three levels: Unkillable 1: Injury affects you normally, but you need never make a HT roll to stay alive. You can survive (and even function, if you remain conscious) down to -10¥HP, at which point your body is physically destroyed and you die. As long as you are alive, you heal at your usual rate – typically 1 HP/day, modified for any Regeneration (p. 80) you may have. Crippled limbs do heal, but severed limbs are gone for good unless you have Regrowth (p. 80). 50 points. Unkillable 2: As Unkillable 1, but you do not die at -10¥HP. Once you reach -10¥HP, you are reduced to an indestructible skeleton and automatically fall unconscious. You sustain no further damage from any attack. Once the damage stops, you heal normally – even if you’ve been hacked to pieces – and any severed body parts will grow back. You regain consciousness once you have positive HP. Note that your enemies can imprison your remains while you are unconscious, or even expose them to a source of continuous damage (fire is a common choice) to prevent you from healing. 100 points. Unkillable 3: As Unkillable 2, except that at -10¥HP, you become a ghost, an energy pattern, or some other incorporeal form that cannot be contained or damaged through normal means. At this stage, you fall unconscious and heal normally. Once you are at full HP, your fully intact body will coalesce in a location of the GM’s choosing. 150 points. With the GM’s permission, if you have Unkillable 2 or 3 and are taken to and use the points to buy a spirit or undead racial template (if such things exist in the setting), becoming a ghost, revenant, etc. once you heal all your HP. By default, you age normally, and will eventually die of old age. To be truly immortal, combine Unkillable with Unaging (above) – and possibly one or more of Doesn’t Breathe (p.49), Injury Tolerance (p. 60), Regeneration Special Limitations Achilles’ Heel: Damage from one particular source (possibly one to which you have a Vulnerability, p. 161) can kill you normally. You must make normal HT rolls to survive at -HP and below, and die automatically if this damage takes you below -5¥HP. The limitation value depends on the rarity of the attack, as defined under Limited Defenses (p. 46): -10% if “Rare,” -30% if “Occasional,” or -50% if “Common” or “Very Common.” Hindrance: A specific substance Regeneration – for as long as it remains in your body. Once you pass out from your injuries, you stay dormant until this substance is removed. The limitation value depends on the rarity of the substance: -5% if “Rare,” Reincarnation: This is only available for Unkillable 2 or 3. When reduced to -10¥HP, you recover at your usual rate, but you wake up in an entirely new body with new abilities. The GM creates the new form (or may allow you to do so), but you always retain the Unkillable advantage. -20%. Trigger: This is only available for Unkillable 2 or 3. Once reduced to to heal. Until then, you will remain dormant. The limitation value depends on the rarity of the trigger: -25% if</desc>

				<nums>2</nums>
				<stat>Variable</stat>
				<desc>This is a “catch-all” trait that the GM can use to adjust the point total of any character with special abilities that are not widely available in the game world. “Special abilities” might mean cinematic traits, magic spells, exotic advantages (for a human), supernatural advantages (for anyone), or almost anything else – it depends on the setting. Players are free to suggest Unusual Backgrounds to the GM, but the GM decides whether a proposed Unusual Background is acceptable, and if so, what its cost and benefits are. Example 1: “Raised by wizards” to justify access to magic spells might be a 0-point special effect in a fantasy world where magic is common, a 10point Unusual Background in a conspiracy campaign where magic is known but kept secret, and a 50-point Unusual Background – or simply forbidden – in a horror game where a PC who wields supernatural power would reduce the suspense. Example 2: “Daughter of the God of Magic” to justify the Unkillable advantage would be an Unusual Background in any setting, and would be worth as much as the advantage itself – 50 points or more – if the GM allowed it at all. Not every unusual character concept merits an Unusual Background. The GM should only charge points when the character enjoys a tangible benefit. For instance, it would be unusual for a human to be raised by wolves, but unless this gave him special capabilities (such as Speak with Animals), it would be background color, worth 0 points.</desc>

				<desc>per extra HP drained You can bite people and drain their life force, healing your own wounds in the process. You can only feed if your victim is helpless (pinned, stunned, unconscious, etc.), grappled, or willing. If he is wearing armor, your biting damage must penetrate its DR. Once you’ve bitten through your victim’s DR, you can drain 1 HP per second from him. For every 3 HP stolen, you heal 1 HP or 1 FP (your choice). You cannot raise your HP or FP above normal this way. The basic Vampiric Bite described above costs 30 points. You may buy increased HP drain for 5 points per additional HP drained per second; for instance, to drain 10 HP per second, pay 75 points. Vampiric Bite also lets you bite in combat without feeding. Treat this as Teeth (Sharp Teeth) or Teeth (Sharp Beak) (p. 91) – your choice.

				<stat>10 points</stat>
				<desc>You can detect the location and size of objects by sensing vibrations with your skin, whiskers, or antennae. You must specify whether this ability works in the air or in the water. Vibration Sense is not a substitute for vision. You can locate an opponent in the dark, but you cannot detect details (e.g., whether he is armed). In a perfectly still, dark chamber, you would have only a vague notion of the size of the area, but you would be able to sense a barrier before you ran into it, and could find openings by sensing the flow of air or water. To use Vibration Sense, make a Sense roll. Consult the Size and Speed/Range Table (p. 550) and apply separate bonuses for the target’s size and speed, and a penalty for the range to the target. Wind (in air) or swift currents (in water) will generate Find the speed of the wind or current on the table and assess the relevant speed penalty. A successful roll reveals the rough size, location, speed, and direction of movement of the target. It does not provide any information about the object’s shape, color, etc. Once you have detected something, you may target it with an attack. The modifiers that applied to your Sense roll also apply to your attack roll, but can never give you a bonus to hit. Note that if you are outside the element (air or water) where your ability functions, or if you are wearing a sealed suit, this ability does not work at all!

The visualization must be detailed and must involve a clear and specific action. This makes it useless in combat, where the situation changes faster than you can visualize it. To use this talent, you must concentrate for one minute. You, the player, must describe the scene you visualize (which can include senses other than sight) and the results you hope to achieve. Then make an IQ roll. You get a +1 bonus to the action you visualized for every point by which you succeed – if the circumstances correspond almost exactly to the visualization. If they are not quite the same, which will almost always be true, halve the bonus (minimum +1). And if something is clearly different, divide the bonus by 3 (no minimum).

				<name>Warp</name>
				<nums>25</nums>
				<stat>100 points</stat>
				<desc>You have the ability to teleport, traveling from point to point without moving through the intervening space. To do so, you must be able to see your destination with your own eyes, or view it remotely (via closed-circuit TV, someone else’s eyes using Mind Reading with the Sensory enhancement, etc.), or visualize it clearly (which is only possible if you have visited it previously in person). You can carry up to Basic Lift when you travel, plus any Payload along other people, take the Extra Carrying Capacity enhancement Make an IQ roll to activate your ability, modified as follows: Distance: Distance penalties appear on the table below. If actual distance falls between two values, use the higher. Distance Penalty 10 yards 0 20 yards -1 100 yards -2 500 yards -3 2 miles -4 10 miles -5 100 miles -6 1,000 miles -7 Add an additional -1 for each 10¥ increase in distance. Preparation Time: The amount of time taken to prepare for the teleport affects the IQ roll, as follows: Preparation Time IQ Modifier None -10 1 second -5 2 seconds -4 4 seconds -3 8 seconds -2 15 seconds -1 30 seconds 0 1 minute +1 2 minutes +2 4 minutes +3 8 minutes +4 15 minutes +5 30 minutes +6 1 hour +7 2 hours +8 4 hours +9 8 hours +10 This table is not open-ended; +10 is the maximum possible bonus. Removal: If you have a “secondhand” view of the destination, you are at -2 per level of removal. For instance, seeing it on TV or through someone else’s eyes would give -2, while seeing it on a television set that you are viewing through someone else’s eyes would give -4. There is an additional -2 to teleport to a place you have visited but cannot see. Fatigue Points: Apply a bonus of +1 per FP spent. You must declare this before you roll, and you lose the FP whether you succeed or fail. You never have to spend FP, but it is usually a good idea if you must travel far or without much preparation. On a success, you appear at your target destination. On a failure, you go nowhere and strain your power: you are at -5 to use it again in the next 10 minutes. On a critical failure, you arrive at the wrong destination. This can be anywhere the GM wishes! It need not be dangerous, but it should seriously inconvenience you. In addition, your power temporarily “burns out” and will not function again for 1d hours. You can use Warp to evade attacks in combat. Once per turn, you may teleport to any location you can see within 10 yards, instantly. This is considered a dodge. Of course, the IQ roll will be at -10 for instant use, so you might want to spend FP to improve your odds! You can improve this ability with practice, spending points to add enhancements or remove limitations. You cannot take Reduced Fatigue Cost or Reduced Time (p. 108); instead, take Reliable (below) so that you will need less time or fewer FP to teleport reliably. Special Enhancements Blind: You can teleport to a specific set of coordinates (distance and direction) without seeing or having visited the destination. This gives you an extra -5 to your IQ roll! You must pay two FP per +1 bonus when using this enhancement. +50%. Extra Carrying Capacity: You can carry more than your Basic Lift. If your carrying capacity is high enough, you may transport one person with you. Light encumbrance is +10%; Medium, +20%; Heavy, +30%; ExtraHeavy, +50%. Reliable: Your power is stable and predictable. Each level of this enhancement gives +1 to the IQ roll to use this ability, allowing you to teleport with little preparation (e.g., in combat) or over long distances without spending as many FP to improve your odds. +5% per +1, to a maximum of +10. Warp Jump: This enhancement is only available if you have the Jumper advantage (p. 64). You must apply it to both Jumper and Warp. If you are both a timeand world-jumper, and wish to use Warp with both abilities, buy this enhancement twice. When you jump, you can simultaneously use Warp to appear anywhere at your destination. Two die rolls are necessary – one per ability – and it is possible for one to succeed while the other fails, or for both to fail. +10% per linked Jumper advantage. Special Limitations Hyperjump: You physically move through “hyperspace” or “jump space” to journey between destinations. This is not true, instantaneous teleportation; you have an effective speed, which means the trip takes time. On long trips, you will need to address life-support needs! In addition, you cannot activate Hyperjump in atmosphere and you cannot travel distances shorter than one light-second (186,000 miles, -10 to IQ). This effectively limits you to space travel. There is one benefit to Hyperjump: if you possess Navigation (Hyperspace) skill, you may substitute it for IQ. -50% if your effective speed is the speed of light one second); -25% if you can travel one light-year (-17 to IQ) per day. Naked: You can carry nothing when you teleport! You always arrive naked. -30%. Psionic Teleportation: Your ability is part of the Teleportation psi power Range Limit: You cannot teleport more than a certain distance per hop. Choose a range and find its distance penalty above. The limitation is worth would be -50%, while 100 miles (-6) would be -20%. A range limit of more than 100,000 miles is not a meaningful limitation.</desc>

Examples: fencing weapons (maingauche, rapier, saber, and smallsword), knightly weapons lance). 30 points. Two weapons normally used together. Examples: broadsword and shield, rapier and main-gauche. 25 points. One specific weapon. 20 points. In all cases, if a weapon can be thrown, the benefits of this advantage also apply when throwing that weapon. When using a suitable weapon, add damage if you know the relevant weapon skill at DX+1. Add +2 per die if you know that skill at DX+2 or better. You also have half the usual penalty to make a Rapid Strike (see Melee Attack Options, p. 369), or to parry more than once per turn (see Parrying, p. 376). None of these benefits apply to default use. You are familiar with – if not proficient in – every weapon within your class. This gives you an improved default: DX/Easy weapon skills default to DX-1, DX/Average ones to DX-2, and DX/Hard ones to DX-3. Note that these skills are no easier to learn, and may not be “bought up” from the improved defaults in order to save points. Finally, you may learn any cinematic skill that names this advantage as a prerequisite (see Chapter 4) – e.g., Blind Fighting and Power Blow – if you could reasonably use that skill with your weapons of choice. The GM is the final arbiter in all cases. This trait is best suited to a “cinematic” swashbuckling game. The GM may wish to forbid it in a realistic campaign.</desc>

				<desc>You can simply do things without knowing how. Once per game session per level of this advantage, you may attempt a roll against any skill, using your score in the appropriate attribute: IQ for IQ-based skills, DX for DX-based skills, etc. You do not incur any default penalties, but situational and equipment modifiers apply normally, as do any modifiers for advantages or disadvantages. Tech level is irrelevant: a TL3 monk could make an IQ roll to use Computer Programming/TL12! Wild Talent does apply to skills that normally have no default, provided you meet any advantage requirements. For instance, you could cast unknown magic spells provided you had Magery, or use unknown cinematic martial-arts skills provided you have Trained By A Master. Wild Talent has no effect on skills you already know. Special Enhancements Retention: You can learn the skills you use! To do so, you must have one unspent character point available when you attempt the skill roll. On a success, you may buy the skill at the one-point level. You cannot improve a skill learned this way for one month, during which time you use it at -2. On a critical success, you can start improving the skill immediately, and there is no -2. On a failure, you cannot learn the skill; on a critical failure, you also lose your unspent character point! Regardless of success, if you lack any of the skill’s prerequisites, your skill is at -4 until you acquire them, and you cannot improve the skill in the interim. This enhancement does not let you learn skills from a TL higher than your own. +25%. Special Limitations Emergencies Only: Your Wild Talent only works in life-threatening situations, such as mortal combat. To use it, you must ask for a particular result related to your predicament. Your request must be specific (e.g., cannot specify a skill (e.g., “Use Judo” or “Cast the Command spell”). The GM will then choose a skill that could bring about the desired result. He is not limited to mundane skills; he may choose a spell if you have Magery, a cinematic martial-arts skill if you have Trained By A Master, and so forth. Once the GM has chosen, roll against the governing attribute, as usual. If the GM feels you already have skills equal to the task, he will advise you on which skill to use. This still counts as one of your uses of Wild Talent! -30%. Focused: You can only use (and if you have Retention, learn) one specific class of skills. Options include Mental (mundane skills based on IQ, Perception, or Will), Physical (mundane skills based on ST, DX, or HT), Magical (spells), and Chi (cinematic martial-arts skill). -20%.</desc>

				<desc>You do not officially exist. Even the highest authorities in the land know nothing about you. In a fantasy setting, you are a “mysterious wanderer”; magical divination cannot discover conclusive details about your past or true identity. In a high-tech world, you don’t appear in the public records – and if computer databases exist, they contain no evidence of your existence. You must provide a reason for this; e.g., your parents hid you away at birth, you are legally dead, or you somehow managed to destroy all the records (explain how!). To maintain this status, you must deal strictly in cash or commodities. Credit and bank accounts must be blind (keyed to pass-code, not a person – the “Swiss bank account”) or set up through a Temporary Identity (see p. 31). If the authorities investigate you, they will initially assume that there has been an error. They will become increasingly concerned as no information can be found about your life. Eventually, they will attempt to apprehend you. If they can’t find you, then they’re likely to give up. But if they catch you, you are in for a thorough interrogation, possibly involving torture, mind probes, or worse. After all, a nonperson has no rights . . . and it will be very difficult for your allies to prove that you are being held, as you don’t officially exist! PERKS A “perk” is a very minor advantage, worth only 1 point. Perks cannot be modified with enhancements or limitations, and they can be added in play without upsetting game balance. Otherwise, perks use the same rules as other advantages. The GM is encouraged to create new perks. No perk should provide wealth, social standing, or combat bonuses. A perk can provide a modest bonus (up to +2) to an attribute, skill, or reaction roll in relatively rare circumstances. The GM may allow more generous bonuses, if they apply only in extremely rare situations. Accessory 31 Your body incorporates a tool or other useful gadget (e.g., a siren or a vacuum cleaner) that provides minor, noncombat benefits not otherwise covered by a specific advantage. Alcohol Tolerance 3 Your body metabolizes alcohol with remarkable efficiency. You can drink steadily for an indefinite period with no major detrimental effects. Binging affects you as it would anyone else. You get +2 on all HT rolls related to drinking. Autotrance 2 You can enter a trance at will. This requires one minute of complete concentration and a successful Will roll, at -1 per additional attempt per hour. This trance gives +2 on rolls to contact spirits, etc. You must make a Will roll to break your trance. If you fail, you can try again every five minutes. Deep Sleeper 3 You can fall asleep in all but the worst conditions, and can sleep through most disturbances. You never suffer any ill effects due to the quality of your sleep. You get an IQ roll to notice disturbances and awaken, just like anyone else; success is automatic if you have Combat Reflexes. Fur 31 You have fur. This prevents sunburn. Thicker fur might justify 1-3 levels each of Damage Resistance (p. 46) and Temperature Tolerance (p. 93), while spiky “fur” might grant Spines traits separately. Honest Face 3 You simply look honest, reliable, or generally harmless. This has nothing to do with your reputation among those who know you, or how virtuous you really are! People who don’t know you will tend to pick you as the one to confide in, or not to pick you if they are looking for a potential criminal or troublemaker. You won’t be spotchecked by customs agents and the like unless they have another reason to suspect you, or unless they are truly choosing at random. You have a +1 to trained Acting skill for the sole purpose of “acting innocent.” No Hangover 3 No matter how much you drink, you will never get a hangover. This does not mitigate the effects of intoxication – it just eliminates the unpleasant aftereffects. Penetrating Voice 3 You can really make yourself heard! In situations where you want to be heard over noise, others get +3 to their Hearing roll. At the GM’s option, you get +1 to Intimidation rolls if you surprise someone by yelling or roaring. Sanitized Metabolism 31 You are totally clean. Your body produces minimal, sanitized waste products, and you never suffer from bad breath, excessive perspiration, or unsightly skin problems. This gives -1 to attempts to track you by scent and elevators, etc.). Shtick 2/3 You have a cool move or slick feature that sets you apart from the masses. This provides no combat or reaction bonuses, and you can’t use it to earn money, but it might occasionally give you some minor benefit in play clothing is always spotless, even after combat or swimming the Nile; you can run, climb, fight, etc. while wearing high heels without suffering any special penalty for bad footing.</desc>
